The model must, per query, judge relevance and decide whether to use,\npartially use, or ignore the context. DyKnow-RAG is a dynamic noisy-RAG\nframework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization.

This teaches when to trust\nretrieval versus fall back to parametric knowledge, without process labels,\nvalue networks, or extra inference passes, preserving single-pass, single-chunk\ndeployment under production latency.

Systems designed to address this\nchallenge are often trained with supervision from warm CF models in order to\nleverage collaborative and content information from the available interaction\ndata. However, since they learn to replicate the behavior of CF methods,\ncold-start models may therefore also learn to imitate their predictive biases.\nIn this paper, we show that cold-start systems can inherit popularity bias, a\ncommon cause of recommender system unfairness arising when CF models overfit to\nmore popular items, thereby maximizing user-oriented accuracy but neglecting\nrarer items. We demonstrate that cold-start recommenders not only mirror the\npopularity biases of warm models, but are in fact affected more severely:\nbecause they cannot infer popularity from interaction data, they instead\nattempt to estimate it based solely on content features. This leads to\nsignificant over-prediction of certain cold items with similar content to\npopular warm items, even if their ground truth popularity is very low. Through\nexperiments on three multimedia datasets, we analyze the impact of this\nbehavior on three generative cold-start methods.

While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains\nvulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)\noffers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,\nhowever, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step\nretrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for\nRAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising\nfrom retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources\nand introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ\nmethod for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning\nprocess by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations\nalter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies\nthe generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,\nthe retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling\nus to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five\npopular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by\nover 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines.
