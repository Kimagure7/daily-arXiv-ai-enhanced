In this paper, we propose a downstream-focussed evaluation framework where a distribution of QPP estimates across a list of top-documents retrieved with several rankers is used as priors for IR fusion. While on the one hand, a distribution of these estimates closely matching that of the true retrieval qualities indicates the quality of the predictor, their usage as priors on the other hand indicates a predictor's ability to make informed choices in an IR pipeline. Our experiments firstly establish the importance of QPP estimates in weighted IR fusion, yielding substantial improvements of over 4.5% over unweighted CombSUM and RRF fusion strategies, and secondly, reveal new insights that the downstream effectiveness of QPP does not correlate well with the standard correlation-based QPP evaluation."}

To address this, we unify the tokenizer and recommender under the ultimate recommendation objective via differentiable soft item identifiers, enabling joint end-to-end training. However, this introduces three challenges: training-inference discrepancy due to soft-to-hard mismatch, item identifier collapse from codeword usage imbalance, and collaborative signal deficiency due to an overemphasis on fine-grained token-level semantics.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose UniGRec, a unified generative recommendation framework that addresses them from three perspectives. UniGRec employs Annealed Inference Alignment during tokenization to smoothly bridge soft training and hard inference, a Codeword Uniformity Regularization to prevent identifier collapse and encourage codebook diversity, and a Dual Collaborative Distillation mechanism that distills collaborative priors from a lightweight teacher model to jointly guide both the tokenizer and the recommender.

However, LLM-based RS (LLM-RS) often inadvertently perpetuates bias present in the training data, leading to severe fairness issues. Addressing these fairness problems in LLM-RS faces two significant challenges. 1) Existing debiasing methods, designed for specific bias types, lack the generality to handle diverse or emerging biases in real-world applications. 2) Debiasing methods relying on retraining are computationally infeasible given the massive parameter scale of LLMs. To overcome these challenges, we propose FUDLR (Fast Unified Debiasing for LLM-RS). The core idea is to reformulate the debiasing problem as an efficient machine unlearning task with two stages. First, FUDLR identifies bias-inducing samples to unlearn through a novel bias-agnostic mask, optimized to balance fairness improvement with accuracy preservation. Its bias-agnostic design allows adaptability to various or co-existing biases simply by incorporating different fairness metrics. Second, FUDLR performs efficient debiasing by estimating and removing the influence of identified samples on model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUDLR effectively and efficiently improves fairness while preserving recommendation accuracy, offering a practical path toward socially responsible LLM-RS.

Existing LSR approaches have relied almost exclusively on uncased backbone models, whose vocabularies exclude case-sensitive distinctions, thereby reducing vocabulary mismatch.

Despite this shift, the impact of backbone model casing on LSR has not been studied, potentially posing a risk to the viability of the method going forward. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate paired cased and uncased versions of the same backbone models across multiple datasets to assess their suitability for LSR. Our findings show that LSR models with cased backbone models by default perform substantially worse than their uncased counterparts; however, this gap can be eliminated by pre-processing the text to lowercase. Moreover, our token-level analysis reveals that, under lowercasing, cased models almost entirely suppress cased vocabulary items and behave effectively as uncased models, explaining their restored performance. This result broadens the applicability of recent cased models to the LSR setting and facilitates the integration of stronger backbone architectures into sparse retrieval.

Existing methods relying on keyword frequency or query spikes are inherently slow and ineffective in these sparse settings, lagging behind real-world shifts in attention. We introduce RTTP, a novel Real-Time Trending Prediction framework that generates search queries directly from news content instead of waiting for users to issue them. RTTP leverages a continual learning LLM (CL-LLM) that converts posts into search-style queries and scores them using engagement strength + creator authority, enabling early trend surfacing before search volume forms. To ensure adaptation without degrading reasoning, we propose Mix-Policy DPO, a new preference-based continual learning approach that combines on-policy stability with off-policy novelty to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during model upgrades. Deployed at production scale on Facebook and Meta AI products, RTTP delivers +91.4% improvement in tail-trend detection precision@500 and +19% query generation accuracy over industry baselines, while sustaining stable performance after multi-week online training. This work demonstrates that LLM-generated synthetic search signals, when aligned and continually updated, unlock timely trend understanding in low-traffic search environments."}

On Twitter (X), approximately one in five tweets contains at least one URL, underscoring their central role in information dissemination. While prior studies have examined the motivations of authors who share URLs, such author-centered intentions are difficult to observe in practice. To enable broader downstream use, this work investigates reader-centered interpretations, i.e., how users perceive the intentions behind hyperlinks included in posts. We develop an intent taxonomy for including hyperlinks in social posts through a hybrid approach that begins with a bottom-up, data-driven process using large-scale crowdsourced annotations, and is then refined using large language model assistance to generate descriptive category names and precise definitions. The final taxonomy comprises 6 top-level categories and 26 fine-grained intention classes, capturing diverse communicative purposes. Applying this taxonomy, we annotate and analyze 1000 user posts, revealing that advertising, arguing, and sharing are the most prevalent intentions. This resulting taxonomy provides a foundation for intent-aware information retrieval and NLP applications, enabling more accurate retrieval, recommendation, and understanding of social media content."}

We sessionize the logs, assign session-level intents and step-wise query-reformulation labels using LLM-based annotation, and propose Context-driven Term Adoption Rate (CTAR) to quantify whether newly introduced query terms are traceable to previously retrieved evidence. Our analyses reveal distinctive behavioral patterns. First, over 90% of multi-turn sessions contain at most ten steps, and 89% of inter-step intervals fall under one minute. Second, behavior varies by intent. Fact-seeking sessions exhibit high repetition that increases over time, while sessions requiring reasoning sustain broader exploration. Third, agents reuse evidence across steps. On average, 54% of newly introduced query terms appear in the accumulated evidence context, with contributions from earlier steps beyond the most recent retrieval. The findings suggest that agentic search may benefit from repetition-aware early stopping, intent-adaptive retrieval budgets, and explicit cross-step context tracking.

Dense retrievers focus primarily on the literal surface form of the query, whereas lightweight rerankers lack the legal-reasoning capacity needed to assess statutory applicability. We present LegalMALR, a retrieval framework that integrates a Multi-Agent Query Understanding System (MAS) with a zero-shot large-language-model-based reranking module (LLM Reranker). MAS generates diverse, legally grounded reformulations and conducts iterative dense retrieval to broaden candidate coverage. To stabilise the stochastic behaviour of LLM-generated rewrites, we optimise a unified MAS policy using Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization(GRPO). The accumulated candidate set is subsequently evaluated by the LLM Reranker, which performs natural-language legal reasoning to produce the final ranking. We further construct CSAID, a dataset of 118 difficult Chinese legal queries annotated with multiple statutory labels, and evaluate LegalMALR on both CSAID and the public STARD benchmark.

Front-Greater Weighting captures conditional semantic information gain by prioritizing early tokens that most effectively reduce candidate-item uncertainty given their prefixes and encode coarse semantics. Frequency Weighting models marginal information gain under long-tailed item and token distributions, upweighting rare tokens to counteract popularity bias. Beyond individual strategies, we introduce a multi-target learning framework with curriculum learning that jointly optimizes the two token-weighted objectives alongside standard likelihood, enabling stable optimization and adaptive emphasis across training stages.

However, models that demonstrate scaling laws are actually challenging to deploy in industrial settings for modeling long sequences of user behaviors, due to the high computational complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. Despite various sparse self-attention mechanisms proposed in other fields, they are not fully suited for recommendation scenarios. This is because user behaviors exhibit personalization and temporal characteristics: different users have distinct behavior patterns, and these patterns change over time, with data from these users differing significantly from data in other fields in terms of distribution. To address these challenges, we propose SparseCTR, an efficient and effective model specifically designed for long-term behaviors of users. To be precise, we first segment behavior sequences into chunks in a personalized manner to avoid separating continuous behaviors and enable parallel processing of sequences. Based on these chunks, we propose a three-branch sparse self-attention mechanism to jointly identify users' global interests, interest transitions, and short-term interests. Furthermore, we design a composite relative temporal encoding via learnable, head-specific bias coefficients, better capturing sequential and periodic relationships among user behaviors. Extensive experimental results show that SparseCTR not only improves efficiency but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, it exhibits an obvious scaling law phenomenon, maintaining performance improvements across three orders of magnitude in FLOPs.

In this work, we focus on post-training denoising. Different from in-training denoising, post-training denoising does not involve changing the architecture of the model nor its training procedure, and does not require additional data. Specifically, we present a method for post-training denoising user profiles using Large Language Models (LLMs) for Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations. Our approach prompts LLMs with (i) a user profile (user interactions), (ii) a candidate item, and (iii) its rank as given by the CF recommender, and asks the LLM to remove items from the user profile to improve the rank of the candidate item. Experiments with a state-of-the-art CF recommender and 4 open and closed source LLMs in 3 datasets show that our denoising yields improvements up to 13% in effectiveness over the original user profiles.

Yet they fall short of traditional recommenders when capturing complex preference patterns. Recent works have tried integrating traditional recommendation embeddings into LLMs to resolve this issue, yet a core gap persists between their continuous embedding and discrete semantic spaces. Intuitively, textual attributes derived from interactions can serve as critical preference rationales for LLMs' recommendation logic. However, directly inputting such attribute knowledge presents two core challenges: (1) Deficiency of sparse interactions in reflecting preference hints for unseen items; (2) Substantial noise introduction from treating all attributes as hints. To this end, we propose a preference hint discovery model based on the interaction-integrated knowledge graph, enhancing LLM-based recommendation. It utilizes traditional recommendation principles to selectively extract crucial attributes as hints. Specifically, we design a collaborative preference hint extraction schema, which utilizes semantic knowledge from similar users' explicit interactions as hints for unseen items. Furthermore, we develop an instance-wise dual-attention mechanism to quantify the preference credibility of candidate attributes, identifying hints specific to each unseen item. Using these item- and user-based hints, we adopt a flattened hint organization method to shorten input length and feed the textual hint information to the LLM for commonsense reasoning. Extensive experiments on both pair-wise and list-wise recommendation tasks verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework, indicating an average relative improvement of over 3.02% against baselines."}

Although reasoning prompting can enhance ranking utility, our preliminary exploration reveals that its benefits are inconsistent and come at a substantial computational cost, suggesting that when to reason is as crucial as how to reason. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning routing framework that employs a lightweight, plug-and-play router head to decide whether to use direct inference (Non-Think) or reasoning (Think) for each instance before generation. The router head relies solely on pre-generation signals: i) compact ranking-aware features (e.g., candidate dispersion) and ii) model-aware difficulty signals derived from a diagnostic checklist reflecting the model's estimated need for reasoning. By leveraging these features before generation, the router outputs a controllable token that determines whether to apply the Think mode. Furthermore, the router can adaptively select its operating policy along the validation Pareto frontier during deployment, enabling dynamic allocation of computational resources toward instances most likely to benefit from Think under varying system constraints. Experiments on three public ranking datasets with different scales of open-source LLMs show consistent improvements in ranking utility with reduced token consumption (e.g., +6.3\\% NDCG@10 with -49.5\\% tokens on MovieLens with Qwen3-4B), demonstrating reasoning routing as a practical solution to the accuracy-efficiency trade-off."}

To address this limitation, we introduce a document-level structural Document MAP (DMAP), which explicitly encodes both hierarchical organization and inter-element relationships within multimodal documents. Specifically, we design a Structured-Semantic Understanding Agent to construct DMAP by organizing textual content together with figures, tables, charts, etc. into a human-aligned hierarchical schema that captures both semantic and layout dependencies. Building upon this representation, a Reflective Reasoning Agent performs structure-aware and evidence-driven reasoning, dynamically assessing the sufficiency of retrieved context and iteratively refining answers through targeted interactions with DMAP. Extensive experiments on MMDocQA benchmarks demonstrate that DMAP yields document-specific structural representations aligned with human interpretive patterns, substantially enhancing retrieval precision, reasoning consistency, and multimodal comprehension over conventional RAG-based approaches.

However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution."}

Despite notable progress in modeling user preferences from historical behaviors, two key challenges persist. First, exsiting discriminative paradigms focus on matching candidates to user history, often overfitting to historically dominant features and failing to adapt to rapid interest shifts. Second, a critical information chasm emerges from the point-wise ranking paradigm. By scoring each candidate in isolation, CTR models discard the rich contextual signal implied by the recalled set as a whole, leading to a misalignment where long-term preferences often override the user's immediate, evolving intent. To address these issues, we propose GenCI, a generative user intent framework that leverages semantic interest cohorts to model dynamic user preferences for CTR prediction. The framework first employs a generative model, trained with a next-item prediction (NTP) objective, to proactively produce candidate interest cohorts. These cohorts serve as explicit, candidate-agnostic representations of a user's immediate intent. A hierarchical candidate-aware network then injects this rich contextual signal into the ranking stage, refining them with cross-attention to align with both user history and the target item. The entire model is trained end-to-end, creating a more aligned and effective CTR prediction pipeline. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

One-pass retrieval-and-write pipelines frequently yield shallow summaries, inconsistent grounding, and weak mechanisms for completeness verification. We introduce ADORE (Adaptive Deep Orchestration for Research in Enterprise), an agentic framework that replaces linear retrieval with iterative, user-steered investigation coordinated by a central orchestrator and a set of specialized agents. ADORE's key insight is that a structured Memory Bank (a curated evidence store with explicit claim-evidence linkage and section-level admissible evidence) enables traceable report generation and systematic checks for evidence completeness. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Memory-locked synthesis - report generation is constrained to a structured Memory Bank (Claim-Evidence Graph) with section-level admissible evidence, enabling traceable claims and grounded citations; (2) Evidence-coverage-guided execution - a retrieval-reflection loop audits section-level evidence coverage to trigger targeted follow-up retrieval and terminates via an evidence-driven stopping criterion; (3) Section-packed long-context grounding - section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form synthesis feasible under context limits. Across our evaluation suite, ADORE ranks first on DeepResearch Bench (52.65) and achieves the highest head-to-head preference win rate on DeepConsult (77.2%) against commercial systems."}

The architecture of an RS model acts as an inductive bias, shaping the patterns the model is inclined to learn. In recent years, numerous recommendation architectures have emerged, spanning traditional matrix factorization, deep neural networks, and graph neural networks. However, their designs are often not explicitly aligned with the top-K objective, thereby limiting their effectiveness.\n  To address this limitation, we propose TopKGAT, a novel recommendation architecture directly derived from a differentiable approximation of top-K metrics. The forward computation of a single TopKGAT layer is intrinsically aligned with the gradient ascent dynamics of the Precision@K metric, enabling the model to naturally improve top-K recommendation accuracy. Structurally, TopKGAT resembles a graph attention network and can be implemented efficiently. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that TopKGAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/StupidThree/TopKGAT."}

However, existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle to effectively incorporate collaborative filtering (CF) signals, due to a fundamental mismatch between item-level preference modeling in CF and token-level next-token prediction (NTP) optimization in LLMs. Prior approaches typically treat CF as contextual hints or representation bias, and resort to multi-stage training to reduce behavioral semantic space discrepancies, leaving CF unable to explicitly regulate LLM generation. In this work, we propose Token-level Collaborative Alignment for Recommendation (TCA4Rec), a model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework that establishes an explicit optimization-level interface between CF supervision and LLM generation. TCA4Rec consists of (i) Collaborative Tokenizer, which projects raw item-level CF logits into token-level distributions aligned with the LLM token space, and (ii) Soft Label Alignment, which integrates these CF-informed distributions with one-hot supervision to optimize a soft NTP objective. This design preserves the generative nature of LLM training while enabling collaborative alignment with essential user preference of CF models. We highlight TCA4Rec is compatible with arbitrary traditional CF models and generalizes across a wide range of decoder-based LLM recommender architectures. Moreover, it provides an explicit mechanism to balance behavioral alignment and semantic fluency, yielding generative recommendations that are both accurate and controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA4Rec consistently improves recommendation performance across a broad spectrum of CF models and LLM-based recommender systems."}

However, existing methods follow an ID-indexed communication paradigm that transmit whole item embeddings between clients and the server, which has three major limitations: 1) consumes uncontrollable communication resources, 2) the uploaded item information cannot generalize to related non-interacted items, and 3) is sensitive to client noisy feedback. To solve these problems, it is necessary to fundamentally change the existing ID-indexed communication paradigm. Therefore, we propose a feature-indexed communication paradigm that transmits feature code embeddings as codebooks rather than raw item embeddings. Building on this paradigm, we present RQFedRec, which assigns each item a list of discrete code IDs via Residual Quantization (RQ)-Kmeans. Each client generates and trains code embeddings as codebooks based on discrete code IDs provided by the server, and the server collects and aggregates these codebooks rather than item embeddings. This design makes communication controllable since the codebooks could cover all items, enabling updates to propagate across related items in same code ID. In addition, since code embedding represents many items, which is more robust to a single noisy item. To jointly capture semantic and collaborative information, RQFedRec further adopts a collaborative-semantic dual-channel aggregation with a curriculum strategy that emphasizes semantic codes early and gradually increases the contribution of collaborative codes over training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that RQFedRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated recommendation baselines while significantly reducing communication overhead."}

To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency."}

However, existing GR methods primarily focus on direct Semantic ID (SID) generation from interaction sequences, failing to activate deeper reasoning capabilities analogous to those in large language models and thus limiting performance potential. We identify two critical limitations in current reasoning-enhanced GR approaches: (1) Strict sequential separation between reasoning and generation steps creates imbalanced computational focus across hierarchical SID codes, degrading quality for SID codes; (2) Generated reasoning vectors lack interpretable semantics, while reasoning paths suffer from unverifiable supervision. In this paper, we propose stepwise semantic-guided reasoning in latent space (S$^2$GR), a novel reasoning enhanced GR framework. First, we establish a robust semantic foundation via codebook optimization, integrating item co-occurrence relationship to capture behavioral patterns, and load balancing and uniformity objectives that maximize codebook utilization while reinforcing coarse-to-fine semantic hierarchies. Our core innovation introduces the stepwise reasoning mechanism inserting thinking tokens before each SID generation step, where each token explicitly represents coarse-grained semantics supervised via contrastive learning against ground-truth codebook cluster distributions ensuring physically grounded reasoning paths and balanced computational focus across all SID codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$GR, and online A/B test confirms efficacy on large-scale industrial short video platform."}

However, current retrieval architectures face a fundamental efficiency dilemma when handling the rigorous logical and arithmetic constraints required by this new paradigm. Standard iterator-based engines (Document-at-a-Time) do not natively support complex, nested logic graphs; forcing them to execute such queries typically results in intractable runtime performance. Conversely, naive recursive approaches (Term-at-a-Time), while capable of supporting these structures, suffer from prohibitive memory consumption when enforcing broad logical exclusions.\n  In this paper, we propose that a retrieval engine must be capable of ``Capturing $\\mathbf{P}$'' -- evaluating any polynomial-time property directly over its index in a computationally efficient manner. We define a formal Retrieval Language ($\\mathcal{L}_R$) based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and prove it precisely captures the complexity class $\\mathbf{P}$. We introduce \\texttt{ComputePN}, a novel evaluation algorithm that makes $\\mathcal{L}_R$ tractable. By combining native DAG traversal with a memory-efficient ``Positive-Negative'' response mechanism, \\texttt{ComputePN} ensures the efficient evaluation of any query in $\\mathcal{L}_R$. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for turning the search index into a general-purpose computational engine."}
