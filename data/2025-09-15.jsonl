However, training\ntransformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost\nassociated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of\nitems. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak\nmemory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length.\nRecognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems\ntypically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss\nwith negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the\nfinal layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model\nperformance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of\nnegative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance,\nbut rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb).\n  In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient\nimplementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates\ntraining by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10\ntimes. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training,\nit becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item\ncatalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss\nfunctions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related\nhyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these\nfactors. We demonstrate that scaling both the number of negative samples and\nbatch size leads to better results rather than maximizing only one of them. To\nfacilitate further adoption of CCE-, we release a Triton kernel that\nefficiently implements the proposed method."}

This strategy, which retrieves\ninformation from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities\nof generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG\nmethods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For\ninstance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many\nretrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex\nquery for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific\nsub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed,\nit can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we\nintroduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently\ntackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG\nroutes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from\nretrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise\nresistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries.

To protect privacy, we introduce a\nsecure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key\nexchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to\nsemi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a\npartially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a\nmulti-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy\nefficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific\nservice requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines\nin task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring\nrobust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G\nedge networks."}

Most existing LLM-based social\nsimulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and\nsimulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona\ngeneration and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona\nsets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing\nhigh-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.\nOur approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from\nlong-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter\nout low-fidelity profiles.

Although their software relies on strict\nverification and validation processes following well-established best-practices\nand certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to\nresidual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at\ndesign-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores\nrun-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the\nresilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European\nTrain Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual\ncontrol flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time\nmonitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly\nlocalization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link\nrelevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a\nreference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its\ncapability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and\nexplainability."}

Communication becomes a major\nbottleneck in such settings but methods like Local Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(Local SGD) show great promise in reducing this additional communication\noverhead. Local SGD consists of three parts: a local optimization process, an\naggregation mechanism, and an outer optimizer that uses the aggregated updates\nfrom the nodes to produce a new model. While there exists an extensive\nliterature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local\noptimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is\nless clear. We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove\nnew convergence guarantees for the algorithm. In particular, we show that\ntuning the outer learning rate allows us to (a) trade off between optimization\nerror and stochastic gradient noise variance, and (b) make up for ill-tuning of\nthe inner learning rate. Our theory suggests that the outer learning rate\nshould sometimes be set to values greater than $1$. We extend our results to\nsettings where we use momentum in the outer optimizer, and we show a similar\nrole for the momentum-adjusted outer learning rate. We also study acceleration\nin the outer optimizer and show that it improves the convergence rate as a\nfunction of the number of communication rounds, improving upon the convergence\nrate of prior algorithms that apply acceleration locally. Finally, we also\nintroduce a novel data-dependent analysis of Local SGD that yields further\ninsights on outer learning rate tuning.

However, these methods frequently\nreduce the interpretability and transparency of the system. In this research,\nwe develop a systematic application, adaptation, and evaluation of deletion\ndiagnostics in the recommender setting. The method compares the performance of\na model to that of a similar model trained without a specific user or item,\nallowing us to quantify how that observation influences the recommender, either\npositively or negatively. To demonstrate its model-agnostic nature, the\nproposal is applied to both Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a widely used\ndeep learning-based recommender, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a\nclassical collaborative filtering technique. Experiments on the MovieLens and\nAmazon Reviews datasets provide insights into model behavior and highlight the\ngenerality of the approach across different recommendation paradigms."}

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied\naccuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc\nencoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose\ngeneralisability."}

We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised,\ntext-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE\ntrains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and\nfine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally\ncombined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original\nencoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain\ndatasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by\n12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines\nin 27 of 32 scenarios."}
