Pre-print", "summary": "Natural-language user profiles have recently attracted attention not only for improved interpretability, but also for their potential to make recommender systems more steerable. By enabling direct editing, natural-language profiles allow users to explicitly articulate preferences that may be difficult to infer from past behavior. However, it remains unclear whether current natural-language-based recommendation methods can follow such steering commands. While existing steerability evaluations have shown some success for well-recognized item attributes (e.g., movie genres), we argue that these benchmarks fail to capture the richer forms of user control that motivate steerable recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies. We assess the steerability of a family of pretrained natural-language recommenders, examine the potential and limitations of steering on relatively niche topics, and compare how different profile and recommendation interventions impact steering effectiveness. Finally, we offer practical design suggestions informed by our findings and discuss future steps in steerable recommender design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSteerEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u771f\u6b63\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7528\u6237\u6863\u6848\u56e0\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SteerEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u5230\u5185\u5bb9\u8b66\u544a\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6863\u6848\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5bf9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c0f\u4f17\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5bf9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "SteerEval\u6846\u67b6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We present A2RAG, an adaptive-and-agentic GraphRAG framework for cost-aware and reliable reasoning. A2RAG couples an adaptive controller that verifies evidence sufficiency and triggers targeted refinement only when necessary, with an agentic retriever that progressively escalates retrieval effort and maps graph signals back to provenance text to remain robust under extraction loss and incomplete graphs.

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

How should these diverse corpora and tasks be sampled for training? Conventional approaches sample them uniformly, proportional to their instance population sizes, or depend on human-level expert supervision. It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute. Our sampling strategy achieves a 5.03 absolute NDCG@10 improvement while training a multilingual bge-m3 model and an absolute NDCG@10 improvement of 0.94 while training all-MiniLM-L6-v2, even when starting from expert-assigned weights on a large pool of training datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Inf-DDS\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u7a20\u5bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u4f18\u5730\u91c7\u6837\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6309\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInf-DDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14GPU\u6d88\u8017\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00bge-m3\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u83b7\u5f975.03\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9NDCG@10\u63d0\u5347\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u83b7\u5f970.94\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9NDCG@10\u63d0\u5347\uff1b3\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5GPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e1.5-4\u500d\uff1b4\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u4ecd\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "Inf-DDS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a20\u5bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, emerging evidence shows that CDR can inadvertently heighten group-level unfairness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis to uncover why these fairness issues arise. Specifically, we identify two key challenges: (i) Cross-Domain Disparity Transfer, wherein existing group-level disparities in the source domain are systematically propagated to the target domain; and (ii) Unfairness from Cross-Domain Information Gain, where the benefits derived from cross-domain knowledge are unevenly allocated among distinct groups. To address these two challenges, we propose a Cross-Domain Fairness Augmentation (CDFA) framework composed of two key components. Firstly, it mitigates cross-domain disparity transfer by adaptively integrating unlabeled data to equilibrate the informativeness of training signals across groups. Secondly, it redistributes cross-domain information gains via an information-theoretic approach to ensure equitable benefit allocation across groups.

In multi-vector retrieval systems, both queries and documents are encoded using one embedding for each token, and similarity between queries and documents is measured by the MaxSim similarity measure. However, the improved recall of multi-vector retrieval comes at the expense of significantly increased latency. This necessitates designing efficient approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms for multi-vector search. In this work, we introduce LEMUR, a simple-yet-efficient framework for multi-vector similarity search. LEMUR consists of two consecutive problem reductions: We first formulate multi-vector similarity search as a supervised learning problem that can be solved using a one-hidden-layer neural network.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum.\n  To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions. Across four real-world datasets and three SR backbones, it consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average improvement of 9.17%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpecTran\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5168\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7ef4\u5ea6\u574d\u7f29\u548cSVD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd9.17%", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u7ef4ID\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7ef4\u5ea6\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1bSVD\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u521a\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u8981\u8c31\u6210\u5206\u800c\u4e22\u5f03\u4e30\u5bcc\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpecTran\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u8c31\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u5206\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6ce8\u5165\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u8981\u8c31\u6210\u5206\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0cSpecTran\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53479.17%\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecTran\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information.

To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $\u03b1$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods.
