During the past decades, most scientists adopted transfer learning and meta learning to solve the problem. Although notable exceptions such as ZeroMat etc. have been invented in recent years, cold-start problem remains a challenging problem for many researchers. In this paper, we build a zeroshot and privacy-preserving recommender system algorithm GreyShot using GM(1,1) model by taking advantage of the Poisson-Pareto property of the online rating data. Our approach relies on no input data and is effective in generating both accurate and fair results. In conclusion, zeroshot problem of recommender systems could be effectively solved by grey system methods such as GM(1,1).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGreyShot\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GM(1,1)\u7070\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46ZeroMat\u7b49\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\u7684Poisson-Pareto\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GM(1,1)\u7070\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63a8\u8350\u7b97\u6cd5GreyShot\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u4f55\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7070\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982GM(1,1)\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper presents IMDMR (Intelligent Multi-Dimensional Memory Retrieval), a novel system that addresses these limitations through a multi-dimensional search architecture. Unlike existing memory systems that rely on single-dimensional approaches, IMDMR leverages six distinct memory dimensions-semantic, entity, category, intent, context, and temporal-to provide comprehensive memory retrieval capabilities. Our system incorporates intelligent query processing with dynamic strategy selection, cross-memory entity resolution, and advanced memory integration techniques. Through comprehensive evaluation against five baseline systems including LangChain RAG, LlamaIndex, MemGPT, and spaCy + RAG, IMDMR achieves a 3.8x improvement in overall performance (0.792 vs 0.207 for the best baseline). We present both simulated (0.314) and production (0.792) implementations, demonstrating the importance of real technology integration while maintaining superiority over all baseline systems. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-dimensional search, with the full system outperforming individual dimension approaches by 23.3%. Query-type analysis reveals superior performance across all categories, particularly for preferences/interests (0.630) and goals/aspirations (0.630) queries. Comprehensive visualizations and statistical analysis confirm the significance of these improvements with p < 0.001 across all metrics.

Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model.

Moreover, the findings reveal that ontology-guided KGs built from relational databases perform competitively to ones built with ontologies extracted from text, with the benefit of offering a dual advantage: they require a one-time-only ontology learning process, substantially reducing LLM usage costs; and avoid the complexity of ontology merging inherent to text-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdRAG\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6807\u51c6\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22RAG\u3001GraphRAG\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6216\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5757\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5757\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u672c\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u672c\u4f53\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model answers.

Existing recommendation unlearning methods, while capable of removing target data influence, suffer from inefficient unlearning speed and degraded performance, failing to meet real-time unlearning demands. Considering the ranking-oriented nature of recommendation systems, we present unranking, the process of reducing the ranking positions of target items while ensuring the formal guarantees of recommendation unlearning. To achieve efficient unranking, we propose Learning to Fast Unrank in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (L2UnRank), which operates through three key stages: (a) identifying the influenced scope via interaction-based p-hop propagation, (b) computing structural and semantic influences for entities within this scope, and (c) performing efficient, ranking-aware parameter updates guided by influence information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate L2UnRank's model-agnostic nature, achieving state-of-the-art unranking effectiveness and maintaining recommendation quality comparable to retraining, while also delivering a 50x speedup over existing methods.

To bridge this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of collaborative information. We begin by clarifying collaborative information in terms of item co-occurrence patterns, identifying its main characteristics, and presenting a quantitative definition.

In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios.

Given that users' complex and intertwined periodic preferences are difficult to disentangle in the time domain, recent research is exploring frequency domain analysis to identify these hidden patterns. However, current frequency-domain-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) They primarily employ static filters with fixed characteristics, overlooking the personalized nature of behavioral patterns; (ii) While the global discrete Fourier transform excels at modeling long-range dependencies, it can blur non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Wavelet Enhanced Adaptive Frequency Filter for Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, it consists of two vital modules: dynamic frequency-domain filtering and wavelet feature enhancement. The former is used to dynamically adjust filtering operations based on behavioral sequences to extract personalized global information, and the latter integrates wavelet transform to reconstruct sequences, enhancing blurred non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. Finally, these two modules work to achieve comprehensive performance and efficiency optimization in long sequential recommendation scenarios.

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u533a\u5206\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u9762\u4e34\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u548c\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5c06LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8fb9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eLLMHNI\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMHNI\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56f0\u96be-\u566a\u58f0\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
