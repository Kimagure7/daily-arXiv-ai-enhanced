Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two\nlimitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals\nin the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2)\nprevious instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while\nignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of\nmobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph\nTokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation).\nSpecifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG)\nformat, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous\ninformation. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into\nan individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure,\nthus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB\nproposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific\nprediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit\nbehaviors.

This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter\nout irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final\nperformance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel\nmetric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct\nanswer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference\nof LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.\nFurther, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to\ntrain a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from\nexact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can\neffectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones\nfor better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing\napproaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm.

Results: The dataset was preprocessed to\ncontain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were\nbenign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition\nto some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven\nthickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong\nmalignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,\nand low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of\nHashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.\nConclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular\nthyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more\naccurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study\nmay serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields."}

Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable\nbecause class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.\nAdditionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces\nsymmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions\nwhere group-fairness is often elusive.

The primary\nissue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,\ncausing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon\nknown as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can\npartially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and\nover-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data\ndistributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,\nenable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face\nchallenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of\ntasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases\nthe potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical\nAdapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters\nfrom different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale\neffectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with\nimproved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that\nhierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank\nadapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on\nadapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,\nfacilitating transfer learning between related tasks.

METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved.

In this work, we present\nChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during\nchart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model\nattention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced\ninterpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided\nattention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our\napproach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains\nof up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results\ndemonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the\nreasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs."}

Wallace"], "title": "Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?", "comment": "34 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal\nrepresentations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer\nLLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and\noperates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually\nprovide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,\nor do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate\npopular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that\nthey succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,\nsuggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization\nmethods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations\noften reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated\nthem, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken\ntogether, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental\ncontrols to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful\ninsights into the operations of LLMs."}
