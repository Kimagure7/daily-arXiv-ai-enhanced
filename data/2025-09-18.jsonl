Here we present a natural language processing (NLP)\nscreening tool to detect high-severity incident reports in radiation oncology\nacross two institutions.\n  METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two text datasets to train and evaluate our\nNLP models: 7,094 reports from our institution (Inst.), and 571 from IAEA\nSAFRON (SF), all of which had severity scores labeled by clinical content\nexperts. We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT. BlueBERT_TRANSFER, which was fine-tuned on both datasets,\nimproved the performance on SF test to AUROC 0.78. Performance of SVM, and\nBlueBERT_TRANSFER models on the manually curated Inst. reports (AUROC 0.85 and\n0.74) was similar to human performance (AUROC 0.81).\n  CONCLUSION: In summary, we successfully developed cross-institution NLP\nmodels on incident report text from radiation oncology centers.

While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency,\nthey often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit\nphysical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are\nphysics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to\nestimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex\nstructures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end\ndifferentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a\nPNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance\ncalculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat\nfeatures. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for\npermeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric\nassumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The\nGNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in\nthe thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using\na single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by\nbackpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation)\nand the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled,\nend-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes\nwell across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and\ntraditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals\nphysically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability.\nThis approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for\npermeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and\nimproving accuracy."}

We propose TFMAdapter, a\nlightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate\ninformation without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on\nthe limited history provided during a single model call, learning a\nnon-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts.\nHowever, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the\nhistory, requiring too many calls to the TSFM.

Seizure detection remains challenging, as\ncurrent clinical practice relies on expert analysis of electroencephalography,\nwhich is a time-consuming process and requires specialized knowledge.\nAddressing this challenge, this paper explores automated epileptic seizure\ndetection using deep learning, focusing on personalized continual learning\nmodels that adapt to each patient's unique electroencephalography signal\nfeatures, which evolve over time. Methods: In this context, our approach\naddresses the challenge of integrating new data into existing models without\ncatastrophic forgetting, a common issue in static deep learning models. We\npropose EpiSMART, a continual learning framework for seizure detection that\nuses a size-constrained replay buffer and an informed sample selection strategy\nto incrementally adapt to patient-specific electroencephalography signals. By\nselectively retaining high-entropy and seizure-predicted samples, our method\npreserves critical past information while maintaining high performance with\nminimal memory and computational requirements. Results: Validation on the\nCHB-MIT dataset, shows that EpiSMART achieves a 21% improvement in the F1 score\nover a trained baseline without updates in all other patients. On average,\nEpiSMART requires only 6.46 minutes of labeled data and 6.28 updates per day,\nmaking it suitable for real-time deployment in wearable systems.\nConclusion:EpiSMART enables robust and personalized seizure detection under\nrealistic and resource-constrained conditions by effectively integrating new\ndata into existing models without degrading past knowledge. Significance: This\nframework advances automated seizure detection by providing a continual\nlearning approach that supports patient-specific adaptation and practical\ndeployment in wearable healthcare systems."}

This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader\ncomputational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse\nproblems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of\nlarge-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an\nend-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from\nsparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial\nintelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data\ngeneration strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of\nthousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from\nyears to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our\nframework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components\nfrom routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue\npermeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated\noutflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography\nwith precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the\nnewly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying\nclinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More\nbroadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving\nsimilar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive\ndomains."}

Concretely, the current\npolicy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy)\nreconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra\ninference-time compute into a teacher signal.
