Motivation: 电商搜索基于结构化库存表示（类别分类法），准确分类用户查询不仅能定位正确库存空间，还能开启多种意图理解能力，对搜索结果相关性和检索约束有重要应用价值。

Method: 探索新颖的Chain-of-Thought范式，结合简单树搜索与LLM语义评分，同时提出可扩展至百万级查询的LLM-based方法。

Result: CoT方法在人工评判的查询-类别对、相关性测试和LLM基准方法评估中，表现优于基于嵌入的查询类别预测基准，并能检测层次分类法中的问题。

Conclusion: CoT方法为电商查询分类提供了有效解决方案，在准确性和问题检测方面优于传统方法，同时提出了可扩展的LLM-based方法以适应大规模应用。

Abstract: Search in e-Commerce is powered at the core by a structured representation of the inventory, often formulated as a category taxonomy. An important capability in e-Commerce with hierarchical taxonomies is to select a set of relevant leaf categories that are semantically aligned with a given user query. In this scope, we address a fundamental problem of search query categorization in real-world e-Commerce taxonomies. A correct categorization of a query not only provides a way to zoom into the correct inventory space, but opens the door to multiple intent understanding capabilities for a query. A practical and accurate solution to this problem has many applications in e-commerce, including constraining retrieved items and improving the relevance of the search results. For this task, we explore a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that combines simple tree-search with LLM semantic scoring. Assessing its classification performance on human-judged query-category pairs, relevance tests, and LLM-based reference methods, we find that the CoT approach performs better than a benchmark that uses embedding-based query category predictions. We show how the CoT approach can detect problems within a hierarchical taxonomy. Finally, we also propose LLM-based approaches for query-categorization of the same spirit, but which scale better at the range of millions of queries.

TL;DR: 本文提出学术概念索引，通过提取和组织论文中的关键概念来改进科学领域检索器的适应，包括概念覆盖的查询生成和概念聚焦的上下文增强，显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将通用领域检索器适应到科学领域面临两大挑战：缺乏大规模领域相关标注数据，以及词汇和信息需求的严重不匹配。现有方法利用LLM生成合成查询或辅助上下文，但忽略了科学文档中嵌入的多样化学术概念，导致查询冗余或概念覆盖狭窄。

Method: 提出学术概念索引，从论文中提取关键概念并按学术分类法组织。在此基础上：1) CCQGen：基于概念覆盖的查询生成，自适应地让LLM基于未覆盖的概念生成互补查询；2) CCExpand：概念聚焦的辅助上下文，利用文档片段作为概念感知查询的简洁回答。

Result: 实验表明，将学术概念索引融入查询生成和上下文增强能产生更高质量的查询、更好的概念对齐，并显著提升检索性能。

Conclusion: 通过学术概念索引结构化科学文档中的概念信息，能有效改进科学领域检索器的适应，解决现有方法忽略概念多样性的问题，为科学信息检索提供更全面的概念覆盖。

Abstract: Adapting general-domain retrievers to scientific domains is challenging due to the scarcity of large-scale domain-specific relevance annotations and the substantial mismatch in vocabulary and information needs. Recent approaches address these issues through two independent directions that leverage large language models (LLMs): (1) generating synthetic queries for fine-tuning, and (2) generating auxiliary contexts to support relevance matching. However, both directions overlook the diverse academic concepts embedded within scientific documents, often producing redundant or conceptually narrow queries and contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce an academic concept index, which extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them guided by an academic taxonomy. This structured index serves as a foundation for improving both directions. First, we enhance the synthetic query generation with concept coverage-based generation (CCQGen), which adaptively conditions LLMs on uncovered concepts to generate complementary queries with broader concept coverage. Second, we strengthen the context augmentation with concept-focused auxiliary contexts (CCExpand), which leverages a set of document snippets that serve as concise responses to the concept-aware CCQGen queries. Extensive experiments show that incorporating the academic concept index into both query generation and context augmentation leads to higher-quality queries, better conceptual alignment, and improved retrieval performance.
