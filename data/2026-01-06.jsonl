To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Knowledge Graph and Deep Learning-Based Semantic Recommendation Database System (KGSR-ADS) for advertisement retrieval and personalization. The proposed framework integrates a heterogeneous Ad-Knowledge Graph (Ad-KG) that captures multi-relational semantics, a Semantic Embedding Layer that leverages large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA to generate context-aware vector representations, a GNN + Attention Model that infers cross-entity dependencies, and a Database Optimization & Retrieval Layer based on vector indexing (FAISS/Milvus) for efficient semantic search. This layered architecture enables both accurate semantic matching and scalable retrieval, allowing personalized ad recommendations under large-scale heterogeneous workloads."}

This work proposes topic-enriched embeddings that integrate term-based signals and topic structure with contextual sentence embeddings. The approach combines TF-IDF with topic modeling and dimensionality reduction, using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to encode latent topical organization, and fuses these representations with a compact contextual encoder (all-MiniLM). By jointly capturing term-level and topic-level semantics, topic-enriched embeddings improve semantic clustering, increase retrieval precision, and reduce computational burden relative to purely contextual baselines. Experiments on a legal-text corpus show consistent gains in clustering coherence and retrieval metrics, suggesting that topic-enriched embeddings can serve as a practical component for more reliable knowledge-intensive RAG pipelines."}

Based on M.Tech thesis research, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, 2025", "summary": "When someone asks ChatGPT to recommend a project management tool, which products show up in the response? And more importantly for startup founders: will their newly launched product ever appear? This research set out to answer these questions.\n  I randomly selected 112 startups from the top 500 products featured on the 2025 Product Hunt leaderboard and tested each one across 2,240 queries to two different large language models: ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Perplexity (sonar with web search).\n  The results were striking. When users asked about products by name, both LLMs recognized them almost perfectly: 99.4% for ChatGPT and 94.3% for Perplexity. But when users asked discovery-style questions like \"What are the best AI tools launched this year?\" the success rates collapsed to 3.32% and 8.29% respectively. That's a gap of 30-to-1 for ChatGPT.\n  Perhaps the most surprising finding was that Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the practice of optimizing website content for AI visibility, showed no correlation with actual discovery rates. Products with high GEO scores were no more likely to appear in organic queries than products with low scores.\n  What did matter? For Perplexity, traditional SEO signals like referring domains (r = +0.319, p < 0.001) and Product Hunt ranking (r = -0.286, p = 0.002) predicted visibility. After cleaning the Reddit data for false positives, community presence also emerged as significant (r = +0.395, p = 0.002).\n  The practical takeaway is counterintuitive: don't optimize for AI discovery directly. Instead, build the SEO foundation first and LLM visibility will follow."}

We present Metadata-Aware Cross-Model Alignment (MACA), which distills a calibrated metadata aware LLM re-ranker into a compact student retriever, avoiding online LLM calls. A metadata-aware prompt verifies the teacher's trustworthiness by checking consistency under permutations and robustness to paraphrases, then supplies listwise scores, hard negatives, and calibrated relevance margins. The student trains with MACA's MetaFusion objective, which combines a metadata conditioned ranking loss with a cross model margin loss so it learns to push the correct answer above semantically similar candidates with mismatched topic, sub-topic, or entity. On a proprietary consumer banking FAQ corpus and BankFAQs, the MACA teacher surpasses a MAFA baseline at Accuracy@1 by five points on the proprietary set and three points on BankFAQs. MACA students substantially outperform pretrained encoders; e.g., on the proprietary corpus MiniLM Accuracy@1 improves from 0.23 to 0.48, while keeping inference free of LLM calls and supporting retrieval-augmented generation."}

We introduce AlignUSER, a framework that learns world-model-driven agents from human interactions. Given rollout sequences of actions and states, we formalize world modeling as a next state prediction task that helps the agent internalize the environment. To align actions with human personas, we generate counterfactual trajectories around demonstrations and prompt the LLM to compare its decisions with human choices, identify suboptimal actions, and extract lessons. The learned policy is then used to drive agent interactions with the recommender system. We evaluate AlignUSER across multiple datasets and demonstrate closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at the micro and macro levels."}

Despite this progress, efficiently promoting dataset sharing and utilization for scientific research remains challenging. Scientific datasets contain intricate domain-specific knowledge and contexts, rendering traditional collaborative filtering-based recommenders inadequate. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to build conversational agents capable of deep semantic understanding and personalized recommendations. In response, we present ScienceDB AI, a novel LLM-driven agentic recommender system developed on Science Data Bank (ScienceDB), one of the largest global scientific data-sharing platforms. ScienceDB AI leverages natural language conversations and deep reasoning to accurately recommend datasets aligned with researchers' scientific intents and evolving requirements. The system introduces several innovations: a Scientific Intention Perceptor to extract structured experimental elements from complicated queries, a Structured Memory Compressor to manage multi-turn dialogues effectively, and a Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Trustworthy RAG) framework. The Trustworthy RAG employs a two-stage retrieval mechanism and provides citable dataset references via Citable Scientific Task Record (CSTR) identifiers, enhancing recommendation trustworthiness and reproducibility. Through extensive offline and online experiments using over 10 million real-world datasets, ScienceDB AI has demonstrated significant effectiveness. To our knowledge, ScienceDB AI is the first LLM-driven conversational recommender tailored explicitly for large-scale scientific dataset sharing services.

Negative sampling is therefore crucial to provide proper negative training signals. However, existing methods tend to mislabel potentially positive but unobserved items as negatives and lack precise control over negative sample selection. We aim to address these by generating controllable negative samples, rather than sampling from the existing item pool. In this context, we propose Adaptive Diffusion-based Augmentation for Recommendation (ADAR), a novel and model-agnostic module that leverages diffusion to synthesize informative negatives. Inspired by the progressive corruption process in diffusion, ADAR simulates a continuous transition from positive to negative, allowing for fine-grained control over sample hardness. To mine suitable negative samples, we theoretically identify the transition point at which a positive sample turns negative and derive a score-aware function to adaptively determine the optimal sampling timestep. By identifying this transition point, ADAR generates challenging negative samples that effectively refine the model's decision boundary. Experiments confirm that ADAR is broadly compatible and boosts the performance of existing recommendation models substantially, including collaborative filtering and sequential recommendation, without architectural modifications."}

In this report, we introduce LACONIC, a family of learned sparse retrievers based on the Llama-3 architecture (1B, 3B, and 8B).

However, the extent to which exposure in generative search engine citations is shaped by external attention markets remains uncertain. In this study, we audit the exposure for 44 Web3 enterprises. First, we show that the creator community around each enterprise is persistent over time. Second, enterprise-specific queries reveal that more popular voices systematically receive greater citation exposure than others. Third, we find that larger follower bases and enterprises with more concentrated creator cores are associated with higher-ranked exposure. Together, these results show that generative search engine citations exhibit exposure bias toward already prominent voices, which risks entrenching incumbents and narrowing viewpoint diversity."}

While previous research has looked at the reliability of LLMs as compared to human assessors, in this work, we aim to understand if LLMs make systematic mistakes when judging relevance, rather than just understanding how good they are on average. To this aim, we propose a novel representational method for queries and documents that allows us to analyze relevance label distributions and compare LLM and human labels to identify patterns of disagreement and localize systematic areas of disagreement. We introduce a clustering-based framework that embeds query-document (Q-D) pairs into a joint semantic space, treating relevance as a relational property. Experiments on TREC Deep Learning 2019 and 2020 show that systematic disagreement between humans and LLMs is concentrated in specific semantic clusters rather than distributed randomly. Query-level analyses reveal recurring failures, most often in definition-seeking, policy-related, or ambiguous contexts. Queries with large variation in agreement across their clusters emerge as disagreement hotspots, where LLMs tend to under-recall relevant content or over-include irrelevant material. This framework links global diagnostics with localized clustering to uncover hidden weaknesses in LLM judgments, enabling bias-aware and more reliable IR evaluation."}

Cross-domain sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising research direction to address this challenge; however, existing approaches face fundamental limitations, such as reliance on overlapping users or items across domains, or unrealistic assumptions that ignore privacy constraints. In this work, we propose a new framework, MergeRec, based on model merging under a new and realistic problem setting termed data-isolated cross-domain sequential recommendation, where raw user interaction data cannot be shared across domains. MergeRec consists of three key components: (1) merging initialization, (2) pseudo-user data construction, and (3) collaborative merging optimization. First, we initialize a merged model using training-free merging techniques. Next, we construct pseudo-user data by treating each item as a virtual sequence in each domain, enabling the synthesis of meaningful training samples without relying on real user interactions. Finally, we optimize domain-specific merging weights through a joint objective that combines a recommendation loss, which encourages the merged model to identify relevant items, and a distillation loss, which transfers collaborative filtering signals from the fine-tuned source models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeRec not only preserves the strengths of the original models but also significantly enhances generalizability to unseen domains. Compared to conventional model merging methods, MergeRec consistently achieves superior performance, with average improvements of up to 17.21% in Recall@10, highlighting the potential of model merging as a scalable and effective approach for building universal recommender systems.

This challenge is exemplified by operations at Fullerton Health, which handles tens of millions of claims annually across nine markets, including Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, and Cambodia. Such variability, coupled with inconsistent image quality and diverse layouts, poses a significant obstacle to automated parsing and structured information extraction.\n  This paper presents a robust multi-stage pipeline that integrates the multilingual optical character recognition (OCR) engine PaddleOCR, a traditional Logistic Regression classifier, and a compact Vision-Language Model (VLM), Qwen 2.5-VL-7B, to achieve efficient and accurate field extraction from large-scale claims data.

In this paper, we pose three main questions: Is it possible to enhance manual prompting? Can LLM memorization be detected through methods beyond manual prompting? And can the detection of data leakage be automated? To address these questions, we evaluate three approaches: (i) jailbreak prompt engineering; (ii) unsupervised latent knowledge discovery, probing internal activations via Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and Cluster-Norm; and (iii) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), which frames prompt discovery as a meta-learning process that iteratively refines candidate instructions. Experiments on MovieLens-1M using LLaMA models show that jailbreak prompting does not improve the retrieval of memorized items and remains inconsistent; CCS reliably distinguishes genuine from fabricated movie titles but fails on numerical user and rating data; and APE retrieves item-level information with moderate success yet struggles to recover numerical interactions.
