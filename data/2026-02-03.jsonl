Existing approaches often make strong assumptions that training and test data come from the same distribution. However, the data distribution varies since user interests are constantly evolving, resulting in the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. In addition, users tend to have multiple interests, some of which evolve faster than others. Towards this end, we propose Disentangled Click-Through Rate prediction (DiseCTR), which introduces a causal perspective of recommendation and disentangles multiple aspects of user interests to alleviate the OOD issue in recommendation. We conduct a causal factorization of CTR prediction involving user interest, exposure model, and click model, based on which we develop a deep learning implementation for these three causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first design an interest encoder with sparse attention which maps raw features to user interests, and then introduce a weakly supervised interest disentangler to learn independent interest embeddings, which are further integrated by an attentive interest aggregator for prediction. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DiseCTR achieves the best accuracy and robustness in OOD recommendation against state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving AUC and GAUC by over 0.02 and reducing logloss by over 13.7%. Further analyses demonstrate that DiseCTR successfully disentangles user interests, which is the key to OOD generalization for CTR prediction.

In multi-country deployments, diverse linguistic, cultural, and product catalog contexts introduce significant distribution shifts, posing substantial challenges to relevance modeling. Existing approaches typically enhance the reasoning or multilingual abilities of a single monolithic model, yet they remain limited by data diversity, coverage gaps, and high inference costs in heterogeneous environments. Our empirical analysis reveals that different LLM base models exhibit complementary strengths across languages and regions, motivating an expert-based architecture. We propose a scalable LLM-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that dynamically routes queries to specialized experts and fuses their embeddings through concatenation. Among rule-based, pseudo-label-based, and fully end-to-end strategies, end-to-end hard routing with concatenation offers the best balance of effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate inference overhead, we further develop an engineering-optimized offline batch pipeline with resource-efficient scheduling, which hides memory latency, improves GPU utilization, and reduces GPU-hour consumption by up to 35% compared with synchronous execution. On datasets spanning six Southeast Asian markets, our MoE improves AUC by 0.72 percentage points over a dense baseline with the same active parameters. Meanwhile, the optimized pipeline achieves 27.6 queries per second (QPS), a 9% throughput improvement. These results demonstrate superior multilingual relevance and efficiency, delivering strong cost-effectiveness for real-world e-commerce search systems."}

However, existing instruction-tuned attributed LLMs often fail to properly interpret the contextual semantics of citation symbols (e.g., [i]) during text generation. This shortcoming arises from their insufficient awareness of the context information surrounding citation markers, which in turn leads to disjointed references and poor integration of retrieved knowledge into the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a novel \\textbf{C}ontextual-aware \\textbf{C}itation generation framework (\\textbf{C$^2$}-\\textbf{Cite}) that explicitly integrates the semantic relationships between citation markers and their referenced content. Specifically, a contextual citation alignment mechanism is adopted: it first encodes the retrieved document contexts into the symbol representation of citations, then aligns the marker numbers by decoding information from a citation router function. This mechanism enables the transformation of citation markers from generic placeholders into active knowledge pointers that link to the referenced source information. Experimental results on the ALCE benchmark across three datasets validate our framework C$^2$-Cite++: it outperforms the SOTA baseline by an average of 5.8\\% in citation quality and 17.4\\% in response correctness.

A major limitation in this space is the lack of high-quality ground-truth Boolean queries for each topic, which makes supervised fine-tuning impractical. AutoBool addresses this challenge by using RL to directly optimize query generation with retrieval measures, without requiring target queries. To support this effort, we create and release the largest dataset of its kind: 65588 topics in total for training and evaluating the task of automatic Boolean query formulation. Experiments on our new dataset and two established datasets (CLEF TAR and Seed Collection) show that AutoBool significantly outperforms zero shot/few shot prompting and matches or exceeds the effectiveness of much larger GPT-based models (e.g., GPT-4o, O3) using smaller backbones.

The Mechanism through Which Review Order Affects Overall Ratings in Premium Service Settings", "comment": null, "summary": "In the increasingly prevalent landscape of high-quality service contexts, whether consumer evaluation interfaces adopt a rating-first or review-first sequence has become a critical factor shaping rating authenticity and feedback quality. While prior research has primarily examined review content and sentiment, systematic investigation into how evaluation order influences rating outcomes remains limited. Through exploratory analyses, we find that Letterboxd -- which employs a review-first, rating-after mechanism -- exhibits a more centralized rating distribution with fewer extreme scores, whereas Yelp -- which adopts a rating-first, review-after mechanism -- shows a pronounced bimodal distribution with more polarized ratings. Three controlled experiments further demonstrate that in high-quality service contexts, a rating-first (vs. review-first) interface significantly elevates consumers' overall ratings. Mechanism analyses indicate that cognitive effort and affective heuristics serve as dual pathways: a rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence reduces cognitive effort and heightens affective heuristics, thereby increasing rating scores. Moreover, service quality moderates this process. When service quality is low, the rating-first (vs. review-first) sequence instead leads to lower ratings. This research reveals the psychological mechanisms through which evaluation order affects consumer ratings via cognitive and affective pathways. It extends theoretical understanding of online rating formation and offers practical implications for optimizing platform interface design to enhance rating authenticity and credibility."}

In this paper, we introduce ChunkNorris, a novel heuristic-based technique designed to optimise the parsing and chunking of PDF documents.

Conventional manual approaches, although methodologically systematic, are resource-intensive and susceptible to subjectivity, whereas heuristic and automated techniques frequently under-perform in recall unless supplemented by extensive expert input. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chained prompt engineering framework for the automated development of search strategies in systematic reviews. The framework replicates the procedural structure of manual search design while leveraging LLMs to decompose review objectives, extract and formalize PICO elements, generate conceptual representations, expand terminologies, and synthesize Boolean queries. In addition to query construction, the framework exhibits superior performance in generating well-structured PICO elements relative to existing methods, thereby strengthening the foundation for high-recall search strategies. Evaluation on a subset of the LEADSInstruct dataset demonstrates that the framework attains a 0.9 average recall. These results significantly exceed the performance of existing approaches. Error analysis further highlights the critical role of precise objective specification and terminological alignment in optimizing retrieval effectiveness.

We propose Linear Position-bias Aware Learning (Linear-PAL), a lightweight framework that enforces de-biasing through structural constraints: explicit feature conjunctions and aggressive regularization. We further introduce a Vectorized Integer Hashing technique for feature generation, replacing string-based operations with $O(N)$ vectorized arithmetic. Evaluating on a large-scale dataset (4.2M samples), Linear-PAL achieves Pareto Dominance: it outperforms Deep Ensembles in de-biased ranking quality (Relevance AUC: 0.7626 vs. 0.6736) while reducing training latency by 43x (40s vs 1762s).

We compare the extraction accuracy of our clinical-trial-specific RAG process against that of publicly available (standalone) LLMs. We also assess the operational impact of AI-assistance on simulated extraction CRC workflows. Our RAG process was measured as more accurate (87.8%) than standalone LLMs with fine-tuned prompts (62.6%) against expert-supported reference annotations. In the simulated extraction workflows, AI-assisted tasks were completed 40% faster, rated as less cognitively demanding and strongly preferred by users.

To address these limitations, we propose SPARC-RAG, a multi-agent framework that coordinates sequential and parallel inference-time scaling under a unified context management mechanism. SPARC-RAG employs specialized agents that maintain a shared global context and provide explicit control over the scaling process. It generates targeted, complementary sub-queries for each branch to enable diverse parallel exploration, and explicitly regulates exiting decisions based on answer correctness and evidence grounding. To optimize scaling behavior, we further introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method with process-level verifiable preferences, which improves the efficiency of sequential scaling and effectiveness of parallel scaling. Across single- and multi-hop QA benchmarks, SPARC-RAG consistently outperforms previous RAG baselines, yielding an average +6.2 F1 improvement under lower inference cost."}

In this work, we introduce RAGRouter-Bench, the first dataset and benchmark designed for adaptive RAG routing. RAGRouter-Bench revisits retrieval from a query-corpus compatibility perspective and standardizes five representative RAG paradigms for systematic evaluation across 7,727 queries and 21,460 documents spanning diverse domains. The benchmark incorporates three canonical query types together with fine-grained semantic and structural corpus metrics, as well as a unified evaluation for both generation quality and resource consumption. Experiments with DeepSeek-V3 and LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that no single RAG paradigm is universally optimal, that paradigm applicability is strongly shaped by query-corpus interactions, and that increased advanced mechanism does not necessarily yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. These findings underscore the necessity of routing-aware evaluation and establish a foundation for adaptive, interpretable, and generalizable next-generation RAG systems."}

While recent research has begun to address fairness in ranking, most existing approaches adopt an equality-based perspective, aiming to ensure that providers with similar content receive similar exposure. However, it overlooks the diverse needs of real-world providers, whose utility from ranking may depend not only on exposure but also on outcomes like sales or engagement. Consequently, exposure-based fairness may not accurately capture the true utility perceived by different providers with varying priorities. To this end, we introduce an equity-oriented fairness framework that explicitly models each provider's preferences over key outcomes such as exposure and sales, thus evaluating whether a ranking algorithm can fulfill these individualized goals while maintaining overall fairness across providers. Based on this framework, we develop EquityRank, a gradient-based algorithm that jointly optimizes user-side effectiveness and provider-side equity. Extensive offline and online simulations demonstrate that EquityRank offers improved trade-offs between effectiveness and fairness and adapts to heterogeneous provider needs."}

Driven by these observations, we propose pivoting away from the CoT structure to directly leverage its underlying mechanism: Reinforcement Learning (RL), to explore the item space. However, applying RL directly faces significant obstacles, notably low sample efficiency-where most actions fail to provide learning signals-and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose RISER, a novel Reinforced Item Space Exploration framework for Recommendation. RISER is designed to transform non-learnable trajectories into effective pairwise preference data for optimization. Furthermore, it incorporates specific strategies to ensure stability, including the prevention of redundant rollouts and the constraint of token-level update magnitudes.

Concurrently, with the rise of large models (LMs), multimodal recommendation is increasingly leveraging their strengths in semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. However, LM representations are inherently optimized for general semantic tasks, while recommendation models rely heavily on sparse user/item unique identity (ID) features. Existing works overlook the fundamental representational divergence between large models and recommendation systems, resulting in incompatible multimodal representations and suboptimal recommendation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose RecGOAT, a novel yet simple dual semantic alignment framework for LLM-enhanced multimodal recommendation, which offers theoretically guaranteed alignment capability. RecGOAT first employs graph attention networks to enrich collaborative semantics by modeling item-item, user-item, and user-user relationships, leveraging user/item LM representations and interaction history. Furthermore, we design a dual-granularity progressive multimodality-ID alignment framework, which achieves instance-level and distribution-level semantic alignment via cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL) and optimal adaptive transport (OAT), respectively. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the unified representations derived from our alignment framework exhibit superior semantic consistency and comprehensiveness. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that our RecGOAT achieves state-of-the-art performance, empirically validating our theoretical insights.

In this work, we take a step towards trustworthy multimodal recommendation from both a method and an analysis perspective. First, we propose a plug-and-play modality-level rectification component that mitigates untrustworthy modality features by learning soft correspondences between items and multimodal features. Using lightweight projections and Sinkhorn-based soft matching, the rectification suppresses mismatched modality signals while preserving semantic consistency, and can be integrated into existing multimodal recommenders without architectural modifications. Second, we present two practical insights on interaction-level trustworthiness under noisy collaborative signals: (i) training-set pseudo interactions can help or hurt performance under noise depending on prior-signal alignment; and (ii) propagation-graph pseudo edges can also help or hurt robustness, as message passing may amplify misalignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones under varying corruption levels demonstrate improved robustness from modality rectification and validate the above interaction-level observations."}

GRAB integrates a novel Causal Action-aware Multi-channel Attention (CamA) mechanism to effectively capture temporal dynamics and specific action signals within user behavior sequences. Full-scale online deployment demonstrates that GRAB significantly outperforms established DLRMs, delivering a 3.05% increase in revenue and a 3.49% rise in CTR. Furthermore, the model demonstrates desirable scaling behavior: its expressive power shows a monotonic and approximately linear improvement as longer interaction sequences are utilized."}

This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity. This helps enforcing a quality-diversity trade-off throughout the user history. Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa. Finally, we illustrate the performance and versatility of B-DivRec in the two settings on synthetic and real-life data sets on movie recommendation and drug repurposing."}

This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking, reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient."}
