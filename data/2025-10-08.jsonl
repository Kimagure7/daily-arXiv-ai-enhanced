To this end, this paper first\nidentifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs\nfinetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within\neach document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and\n(2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query\ntokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that\ndocument's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce\nBlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the\nattention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed\ninter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to\nlinear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block\nrelevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary\ncontrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments\non BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches\nor outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned\nbaseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100\nMSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context\nshortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length)\nwithin a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR."}

This paper presents an automated framework for research\narticle classification and recommendation that leverages Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. Using a large-scale arXiv.org\ndataset spanning more than three decades, we evaluate multiple feature\nextraction approaches (TF--IDF, Count Vectorizer, Sentence-BERT, USE,\nMirror-BERT) in combination with diverse machine learning classifiers (Logistic\nRegression, SVM, Na\\\"ive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and\nk-Nearest Neighbour). Our experiments show that Logistic Regression with\nTF--IDF consistently yields the best classification performance, achieving an\naccuracy of 69\\%. To complement classification, we incorporate a recommendation\nmodule based on the cosine similarity of vectorized articles, enabling\nefficient retrieval of related research papers. The proposed system directly\naddresses the challenge of information overload in digital libraries and\ndemonstrates a scalable, data-driven solution to support literature discovery."}

Besides, a\nlargely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning\nto capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between\nitems, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional\nID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent\nframework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation\ntools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while\nutilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on\npersonalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement\nrelationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination,\nscales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through\nrelational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery\ndatasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking\nperformance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying\ntools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly\nmeasures semantic alignment and ranking correctness."}

However, the\ninteractive nature of these systems poses significant challenges for automatic\nevaluation. This paper critically examines current evaluation practices and\nidentifies two key limitations: the over-reliance on static test collections\nand the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. To substantiate this\ncritique, we analyze real user interactions with nine existing CRSs and\ndemonstrate a striking disconnect between self-reported user satisfaction and\nperformance scores reported in prior literature. To address these limitations,\nthis work explores the potential of user simulation to generate dynamic\ninteraction data, offering a departure from static datasets. Furthermore, we\npropose novel evaluation metrics, based on a general reward/cost framework,\ndesigned to better align with real user satisfaction. Our analysis of different\nsimulation approaches provides valuable insights into their effectiveness and\nreveals promising initial results, showing improved correlation with system\nrankings compared to human evaluation. While these findings indicate a\nsignificant step forward in CRS evaluation, we also identify areas for future\nresearch and refinement in both simulation techniques and evaluation metrics."}

Over the past decade, researchers have extensively critiqued\nrecommender systems that prioritise news based on user engagement. To offer an\nalternative, researchers have analysed how recommender systems could support\nthe media's ability to fulfil its role in democratic society by recommending\nnews based on editorial values, particularly diversity. However, there\ncontinues to be a large gap between normative theory on how news recommender\nsystems should incorporate diversity, and technical literature that designs\nsuch systems. We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in\npractice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to\ntrain modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First,\nwe identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of\nthe diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature.\nBased on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public\ndatasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into\ndiversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European\nlaw and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the\ndata they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems."}
