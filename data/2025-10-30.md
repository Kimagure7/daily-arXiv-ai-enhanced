Abstract: In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in
modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring
optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent
research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator
produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In
practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.
However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the
separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,
autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address
the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an
autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic
autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we
pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter
initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating
sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we
propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient
autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),
which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items
while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time
recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF
outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is
nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also
been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily
active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.

*Yehjin Shin,Jeongwhan Choi,Seojin Kim,Noseong Park*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出TV-Rec模型，使用时变卷积滤波器替代固定核和自注意力机制，在序列推荐中捕获位置依赖的时间变化，实现更高表达能力和更高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卷积滤波器多为固定滤波器，难以捕获序列推荐中所需的全局交互，通常需要补充自注意力机制。

Method: 受图信号处理启发，使用时变图滤波器捕获用户序列中位置依赖的时间变化，替代固定核和自注意力机制。

Result: 在六个公共基准测试上，TV-Rec平均优于最先进基线7.49%。

Conclusion: 时变滤波器设计不仅消除了对自注意力的需求，还减少了计算量并加速了推理过程。

Abstract: Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential
recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However,
most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This
is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to
capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose
Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a
model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters
capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing
both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec
achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction
patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for
self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中项目多面特征和动态相关性的问题，提升推荐模型的可扩展性和效果

Method: 将传统单一嵌入矩阵分解为多个低维嵌入矩阵，并在Fuxi Block中用MoE层替换相关参数，实现自适应和专业化表示转换

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该框架优于多个竞争基线方法

Conclusion: Fuxi-MME框架通过多嵌入和MoE架构有效提升了推荐系统的性能和可扩展性

Abstract: In recommendation systems, how to effectively scale up recommendation models
has been an essential research topic. While significant progress has been made
in developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential
recommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items'
multi-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context.
To address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a
multi-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
Specifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a
decoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into
several lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting
relevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves
adaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations.
Empirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework
outperforms several competitive baselines.

### [4] [Towards Automated Quality Assurance of Patent Specifications: A Multi-Dimensional LLM Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25402)
*Yuqian Chai,Chaochao Wang,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一个专利质量评估框架，通过合规性、技术连贯性和图文一致性检测模块评估专利质量，并生成改进建议。在160份专利数据集上验证，检测准确率分别达到99.74%、82.12%和91.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管专利申请激增且AI起草工具涌现，但专利内容质量的系统性评估研究有限，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用三个检测模块（监管合规性、技术连贯性、图文一致性）评估专利质量，通过集成模块生成改进建议。在80份人工撰写和80份AI生成专利数据集上进行验证。

Result: 三个检测模块的平衡准确率分别为99.74%、82.12%和91.2%。AI生成专利相比人工撰写专利存在显著差距，主要表现出图文对齐和交叉引用等结构性缺陷。

Conclusion: 专利质量评估框架有效识别不同类型缺陷，机械工程和建筑领域存在更多权利要求-说明书不一致问题，AI生成专利需要特别关注结构性缺陷。

Abstract: Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools,
systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research
attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory
compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection
modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module.
The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80
human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools.
Experimental results show balanced accuracies of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\%
respectively across the three detection modules when validated against expert
annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions
across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based
analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision
require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more
claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation
requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to
human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain
surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural
defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.

### [6] [Generalized Pseudo-Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25488)
*Yiteng Tu,Weihang Su,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu,Fen Lin,Qin Liu,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GPRF的通用伪相关反馈框架，通过自然语言重写查询，消除了模型假设并减少了对相关性假设的依赖，使用强化学习训练以确保对噪声反馈的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PRF和VPRF方法基于相关性假设和模型假设，而基于LLM的GRF方法要么存在严重幻觉问题，要么仍然依赖相关性假设。需要克服这些限制，开发一个假设更宽松的查询重写框架。

Method: 设计了基于强化学习的效用导向训练流程，进行模型无关的自然语言重写，利用检索文档但不依赖特定模型架构或强相关性假设。

Result: 在多个基准测试和检索器上的广泛实验表明，GPRF始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: GPRF是一个有效且可泛化的查询重写框架，通过放松假设实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It
typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the
query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and
relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its
vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging
top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed
based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are
relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed
specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language
models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free
query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,
relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting
quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed
framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which
performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,
not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the
relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training
pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy
feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers
demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing
it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.

Method: 提出MMQ-v2混合量化框架，包含自适应行为-内容对齐机制（防止噪声污染）和动态行为路由器（放大重要信号），生成ADA-SID语义ID。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上的实验表明，ADA-SID在生成式和判别式推荐任务中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADA-SID通过自适应对齐、去噪和放大机制，有效解决了语义ID学习中的关键挑战，为推荐系统提供了更强大的表示能力。

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).
However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,
dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data.Content-based Semantic IDs
(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,
by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have
limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral
information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform
content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,
creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and
long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise
Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative
noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to
the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The
equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of
different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to
distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we
propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,
Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior
modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this
framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive
behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield
representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical
signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public
and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant
superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.
