Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了PBR框架，在检索前通过个性化查询扩展解决RAG系统中的用户语义差异问题，包含P-PRF和P-Anchor两个组件，在个性化基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的查询扩展方法采用统一策略，忽略了用户特定的表达风格、偏好和历史上下文，导致相同文本查询可能表达完全不同的意图，限制了系统在个性化环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PBR框架，包含：1) P-PRF：利用用户历史生成风格对齐的伪反馈来模拟用户表达风格；2) P-Anchor：基于图的结构对齐方法捕捉用户语料库的语义结构。两者共同生成个性化的查询表示。

Result: 在两个个性化基准测试中，PBR始终优于强基线方法，在PersonaBench上相对于不同检索器获得了高达10%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 在检索前建模个性化对于缩小用户自适应RAG系统中的语义差距具有重要价值，PBR框架有效解决了用户表达多样性和语料库语义结构异质性两大核心挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query
expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods
adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring
individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,
identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.
This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to
generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two
core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently
diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized
intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in
topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of
expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,
we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates
user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of
two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback
using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which
performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its
structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored
for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR
consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench
across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling
personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG
systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.

### [2] [SHERLOCK: Towards Dynamic Knowledge Adaptation in LLM-enhanced E-commerce Risk Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08948)
*Nan Lu,Yurong Hu,Jiaquan Fang,Yan Liu,Rui Dong,Yiming Wang,Rui Lin,Shaoyi Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了SHERLOCK框架，利用大语言模型的推理能力辅助电商风险调查，通过构建领域知识库、智能平台和反思优化模块，显著提升风险调查效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商行业增长加剧了风险管理的挑战，大量案件分析给风险分析师带来沉重负担，且分析师个体差异阻碍了标准化工作流程的建立。

Method: 1) 从多模态数据提取风险管理知识构建领域知识库；2) 基于数据飞轮范式构建智能平台，整合日常操作、专家标注和模型评估；3) 引入反思优化模块与领域知识库协作，建立快速响应机制。

Result: 在京东真实交易数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了LLM分析结果的事实对齐精度和风险定位精度，部署后大幅提升了风险经理的案件调查效率。

Conclusion: SHERLOCK框架有效解决了电商风险管理中的工作负担和标准化问题，通过LLM推理能力与领域知识结合，实现了高效的风险调查工作流程。

Abstract: The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial
dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies
often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging
fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc
governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial
workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of
long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk
dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the
establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these
challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk
investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1)
extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a
domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the
data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations,
and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment,
and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the
domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns.
Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both
factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results.
Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially
enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

### [3] [Rethinking Reasoning in Document Ranking: Why Chain-of-Thought Falls Short](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08985)
*Xuan Lu,Haohang Huang,Rui Meng,Yaohui Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了在文档重排序任务中使用链式思维推理的效果，发现在点式和列表式重排序中，推理增强的重排序器表现均不如直接预测排名的模型，且推理成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型推动了在LLM重排序器中加入显式推理链的趋势，但推理在排序任务中的有效性尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在系统研究推理在重排序中的作用。

Method: 在点式和列表式设置下，通过监督微调和强化学习，使用多样化基准（包括推理密集型数据集BRIGHT和标准IR基准BEIR）进行系统研究。

Result: 推理增强的重排序器在所有设置下都表现不如直接预测排名的模型，存在三个核心局限：点式重排序中推理破坏校准并偏向正类；列表式重排序中推理提高域内拟合但增加方差且泛化能力差；直接微调的重排序器更稳定有效。

Conclusion: 显式推理对重排序并非普遍有益，未来研究方向包括点式重排序的校准感知评分和列表式重排序中简洁、有针对性的推理策略设计。

Abstract: Document reranking is a key component in information retrieval (IR), aimed at
refining initial retrieval results to improve ranking quality for downstream
tasks. Recent studies--motivated by large reasoning models (LRMs)--have begun
incorporating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-based
rerankers. However, the effectiveness of such reasoning for ranking tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of
reasoning in reranking across both pointwise and listwise settings, under both
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Using diverse benchmarks,
including reasoning-intensive datasets (BRIGHT) and standard IR benchmarks
(BEIR), we find that reasoning-augmented rerankers consistently underperform
their direct counterparts that predict rankings without CoT, despite
substantially higher inference costs. Our analysis reveals three core
limitations: (i) in pointwise rerankers, reasoning breaks calibration and
biases models toward the positive class, raising TPR but lowering TNR, which
inflates false positives and degrades ranking in negative-dominant pools; (ii)
in listwise rerankers, reasoning improves in-domain fit but increases variance
and fails to generalize out-of-domain, even when reinforcement learning
shortens rationales; and (iii) overall, directly fine-tuned rerankers remain
more stable, effective, and robust. These findings challenge the assumption
that explicit reasoning is universally beneficial for reranking. We conclude by
highlighting future directions, including calibration-aware scoring for
pointwise rerankers and the design of concise, targeted reasoning strategies to
mitigate overfitting and overthinking in listwise rerankers.

### [4] [Generative Data Augmentation in Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09129)
*Yansong Wang,Qihui Lin,Junjie Huang,Tao Jia*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出GDA4Rec框架，使用生成式数据增强和图对比学习来改进推荐系统中的嵌入学习，通过深度生成模型生成高质量增强视图并提供鲁棒的自监督信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中从稀疏用户-物品交互中学习有效嵌入的挑战，现有随机数据增强方法会改变原始语义信息，需要更高质量的增强视图。

Method: 使用噪声生成模块通过深度生成模型近似原始数据分布进行数据增强；提取物品互补矩阵表征物品间潜在相关性；采用融合推荐、数据增强和对比学习的联合目标函数。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛实验证明了模型的优越性。

Conclusion: GDA4Rec框架能够生成高质量增强视图，提供鲁棒自监督信号，学习更有效和信息丰富的嵌入表示。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms,
from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain
is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While
contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this
issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most
existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of
original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for
Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust
self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that
leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original
data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item
complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and
provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that
integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used
to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of the model. The code is available at:

### [5] [Controlled Personalization in Legacy Media Online Services: A Case Study in News Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09136)
*Marlene Holzleitner,Stephan Leitner,Hanna Lind Jorgensen,Christoph Schmitz,Jacob Welander,Dietmar Jannach*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文通过A/B测试评估了传统新闻媒体采用控制性个性化策略的效果，发现适度个性化能显著提升点击率、降低导航成本，同时增加内容多样性并减少流行度偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新闻媒体在采用个性化推荐技术时面临平衡技术创新与编辑价值观的挑战，需要找到既能提升用户体验又能维护新闻专业标准的方法。

Method: 在挪威一家主要传统新闻机构的网站上进行了A/B测试，比较了编辑策划内容与算法推荐内容相结合的控制性个性化策略。

Result: 个性化内容显著提高了点击率，降低了用户导航成本，提升了内容发现效率，同时增加了内容多样性和目录覆盖率，减少了流行度偏见。

Conclusion: 控制性个性化策略能够成功协调用户需求与编辑目标，为传统媒体采用个性化技术同时维护新闻价值观提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendations have become a standard feature of large
news aggregation services, optimizing user engagement through automated content
selection. In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization
cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial
values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically
combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a
strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we
evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test
conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our
findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields
substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to
personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced
navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover,
our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater
content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias.
Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully
align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media
to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.

### [6] [Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167)
*Minmao Wang,Xingchen Liu,Shijie Yi,Likang Wu,Hongke Zhao,Fei Pan,Qingpeng Cai,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HSRL通过引入固定的语义动作空间和分层策略网络，解决了推荐系统中强化学习面临的大规模动态动作空间问题，在公开基准和实际生产环境中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统大多优化短期参与度，而强化学习方法面临大规模动态动作空间的挑战，导致策略学习不稳定。

Method: 提出分层语义强化学习(HSRL)，使用语义ID表示物品构建固定语义动作空间，通过分层策略网络进行粗到细的决策，并采用多级评论家进行细粒度信用分配。

Result: 在公开基准和大型短视频广告平台数据集上均超越最先进基线方法，在线A/B测试7天内实现18.421%的转化率提升，成本仅增加1.251%。

Conclusion: HSRL为基于强化学习的推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的范式，有效解决了大规模动作空间带来的训练稳定性问题。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While
most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has
begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.
However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic
action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.
To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which
reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL
encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to
their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align
decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)
operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state
modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,
thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In
parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,
enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a
large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising
platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online
deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with
only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for
RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at
https://github.com/MinmaoWang/HSRL.

*Dakai Zhai,Jiong Gao,Boya Du,Junwei Xu,Qijie Shen,Jialin Zhu,Yuning Jiang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出ChoirRec框架，利用大语言模型的语义能力构建语义用户群体，解决低活跃用户转化率预测的三大挑战：噪声信号、信息不足和训练偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模电商推荐系统中低活跃用户转化率预测的三个关键问题：依赖噪声行为信号、用户级信息不足、训练偏向高活跃用户。

Method: 采用双通道架构，包含三个模块：语义群体生成（使用LLM形成可靠用户集群）、群体感知分层表示（丰富稀疏用户嵌入）、群体感知多粒度模块（双通道架构和自适应融合机制）。

Result: 在淘宝平台上进行线下和线上实验，线下评估GAUC提升1.16%，线上A/B测试订单量增加7.24%。

Conclusion: ChoirRec框架通过语义用户群体构建和跨用户知识转移，显著提升了低活跃用户的转化率预测性能，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a
fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing
approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and
unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to
the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward
high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address
these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the
semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic
user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a
dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer,
ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module
that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby
filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation
module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors
to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity
Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism
to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct
extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale
e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations,
while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume,
highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

*Siyue Zhang,Yuan Gao,Xiao Zhou,Yilun Zhao,Tingyu Song,Arman Cohan,Anh Tuan Luu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MRMR是首个需要深度推理的多学科多模态检索基准，包含1502个跨23个领域的查询，通过引入多领域挑战、推理密集型任务和图像-文本交错序列，为多模态检索系统提供了更现实的评估环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索基准在跨领域专业知识、深度推理能力和多模态交互方面存在局限，需要构建更现实、更具挑战性的多模态检索评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1502个查询的基准数据集，涵盖23个专业领域，引入矛盾检索新任务，采用图像-文本交错序列的查询和文档构建方式，评估4类14个前沿多模态检索模型。

Result: 文本嵌入模型Qwen3-Embedding结合LLM生成的图像描述表现最佳，最新多模态模型在专业领域查询中表现有竞争力，但在推理密集型任务上表现不足。

Conclusion: MRMR为推进多模态检索在更现实和具有挑战性的场景中发展铺平了道路，现有模型在推理密集型多模态检索方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal
retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries
spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human
experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements.
First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise,
enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are
reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as
diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a
novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries
and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike
earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR
offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus
documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal
retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model
Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest
performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval
models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform
competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive
tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in
more realistic and challenging scenarios.

*Tzu-Lin Kuo,Wei-Ning Chiu,Wei-Yun Ma,Pu-Jen Cheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Doc2Query++是一个文档扩展框架，通过无监督主题建模推断文档的潜在主题，然后使用混合关键词选择创建多样化关键词集，指导LLM生成相关查询，并通过双索引融合策略提升密集检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档扩展中存在的生成控制不足、跨域泛化能力差以及查询拼接对密集检索产生噪声等问题。

Method: 使用无监督主题建模推断文档潜在主题，通过混合关键词选择创建多样化关键词集指导LLM生成查询，并采用双索引融合策略分离文本和查询信号。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线方法，在MAP、nDCG@10和Recall@100等指标上取得显著提升，适用于稀疏和密集检索。

Conclusion: Doc2Query++通过结构化查询生成和双索引融合策略，有效解决了文档扩展中的关键挑战，在跨域场景下实现了优越的检索性能。

Abstract: Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in
sparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing
hallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from
in-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise
from concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and
taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE
framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's
latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability,
then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword
set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure
comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through
diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense
retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query
signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show
Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on
both sparse and dense retrieval.
