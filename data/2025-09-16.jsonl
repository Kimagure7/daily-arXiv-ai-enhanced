SPARK first employs\nTucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity\nrepresentations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN\nconcurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the\nlatter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical\nstructures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items.\nA core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that\ndynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG\nembeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both\nmainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these\nmulti-source representations.

Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches.

A CNN-Transformer ensemble\nmodel was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions.\nBy linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of\nits kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value\nfor workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling."}

Traditional pruning approaches often depend on\nhand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to\nsuboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework\ntransforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the\ntarget neural network that captures complete topological relationships between\nlayers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a\nglobal view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph\nrepresentation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action\nspace we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary\naction spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance\ncriteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.\nThese contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process\n(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while\nadhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we\ndesign a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform\nits previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints.

To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a\nneuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods\nmitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically\nrequiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only\ncompact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal\narchitecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity\npatterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving\ncritical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual\nconcepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in maintaining model versatility.

We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines\nthe mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the\nflexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the\nconcept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear\nfunctions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is\nmodeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation\nof the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based\nformalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which\nextends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the\nmathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,\nwhich represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which\nuses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results\nshow that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple\npolynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,\nNN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex\nnonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip\nsystems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based\nframework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities\nwhile maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the\nCCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with\ndiscontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using\ntraditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool\nfor nonlinear system identification."}

M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that\npairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by\nmodal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically\nconsistent nodes.

Despite their widespread deployment, the\nrobustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We\npresent GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework\ndesigned to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced\nhardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for\ninjecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation\ninjections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained\ntransformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our\nframework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer\narchitectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent\ndependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop\nPyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment\nreproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail\nthe technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through\nseveral example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling\ncontrolled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a\ntransformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable\ntool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in\nreal-world LLM applications."}

This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative\nAI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a\ndual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive\nprocesses and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,\neach carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue\nact types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for\ninformation, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using\nlanguage creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different\ntypes of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social\ngreetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that\ngenerative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful\nways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users\nthink and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more\nconfidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides\nempirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive\ndevelopment in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation\nand socio-cultural affiliation.

Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches\nare vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction\nprocess, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a\nnovel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key\ncomponents: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction\nmechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components\nwork synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and\nglobal structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and\nassess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity.

This paper focuses\non comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including\ncentralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning\nenvironments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model\nflatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general\ntheoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from\nlocal minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.\nWe show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the\nattack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,\ndecentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and\ndiffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the\ncentralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the\nperturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation\nresults, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the\nperformance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized\nadversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of\ndecentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed\nsettings."}

However,\nthey rely on the Markovian assumption - that future states depend only on the\ncurrent state - which is often untrue in real-world scenarios where the\ndynamics may depend on the history of past states. This limitation becomes\nespecially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex\nsystems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies,\nexisting approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based\nencoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling.\nIn addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior. In this work, we\ninvestigate the use of the signature transform as an encoder for learning\nnon-Markovian dynamics in a continuous-time setting. The signature transform\noffers a continuous-time alternative with strong theoretical foundations and\nproven efficiency in summarizing multidimensional information in time. We\nintegrate a signature-based encoding scheme into encoder-decoder dynamics\nmodels and demonstrate that it outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test\nperformance on synthetic benchmarks."}

We propose a general formulation of the\nrisk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's\nreturn distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting\nand assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited\nexpressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and\nsufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.\nBuilding on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC\nand RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and\nknown, respectively.

Better predictions require models capable of\naccommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and\ncomplex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency\nmatrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)\nvalues to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather\nfactors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights\nand enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic\nstations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)\nframework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target\ncoverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline\nmethods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,\nvalidate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying\nMonte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under\nTest (VUT) to reflect real-world variability.

Submitted to arXiv in Computation and\n  Language", "summary": "Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI\nmodels are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a\nsystematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM,\nXLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning\nclassification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated\nnotable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in\nmultilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we\nintroduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs\n(false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that\ncollectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from\npolitics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are\nfact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery\ndataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as\nRemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in\nlow-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable\nlimitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these\nperformance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is\npublicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further\nexperimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and\nthe current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation\ndetection."}

Recent research\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide\nresponse-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle\nto identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as\nthose arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user\nbehavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for\ndetecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft\nClustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based\napproach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by\namplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based\nSample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation\nlearning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 --\nacross multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for\ndetecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong\ngeneralization to unknown intent detection."}

Although various strategies have been proposed to\nmitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation,\nneglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we\nintroduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM\nbenchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid\nBenchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items\ndepends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to\neach LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model\nbased on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to\nselect evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing\nin education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the\ncommon practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated\nbaselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We\nexamine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --\nand find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them\n(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).\nOur analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct\neffects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability\nspace, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.\nOverall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved\nby moving beyond static evaluation."}

CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision\nlanguage models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a\ndistributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic\ninference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with\nthe document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities.\nUnlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document\nwithout repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit\nword-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six\nmultimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and\nmultimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61.

However, the extent to which\nthis high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from\na Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as\nLLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a\ndataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians\npursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate\nand compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the\nfine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice\nquestion-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12\nmedical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:\nmedgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of\ncorrect answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion\nparameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results\n<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all\nLLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters\nacross various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and\nresearch that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those\nexhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties\nshould utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it."}

Although\nrecent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,\ngenerating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to\nthe highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative\nguidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the\ndifferences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and\nphysical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the\nacquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors\neffectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we\nillustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and\nboxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.\nExperiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of\ndirections merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.\nCoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on\nboxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their\ncorresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find\nCoachMe here: https://motionxperts.github.io/"}

These publicly shared\ndiscussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and\nsuccess stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this\ninformation for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured\nand domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and\nspecialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis\ntechniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,\nthereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support\nstrategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User\neXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130\nartificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a\npublic industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)\nrecord contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software\nproducts, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a\nlarge language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and\nannotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,\nand topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research\nin user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback\nprocessing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access\nto real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of\ntransformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis,\nand requirements extraction in the context of technical forums."}
