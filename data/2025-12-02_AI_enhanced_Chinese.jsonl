We present a novel framework that enhances talent search effectiveness and delivers substantial business value through two key innovations: (i) leveraging LLMs to extract fine-grained recruitment signals from job descriptions and historical hiring data, and (ii) employing a role-aware multi-gate MoE network to capture behavioral differences across recruiter roles. To further reduce noise, we introduce a multi-task learning module that jointly optimizes click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), and resume matching relevance. Experiments on real-world recruitment data and online A/B testing show relative AUC gains of 1.70% (CTR) and 5.97% (CVR), and a 17.29% lift in click-through conversion rate.

This study presents SAFE (system for accurate fact extraction and evaluation), an agent system that combines large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve automated fact-checking of long-form COVID-19 misinformation. SAFE includes two agents - one for claim extraction and another for claim verification using LOTR-RAG, which leverages a 130,000-document COVID-19 research corpus. An enhanced variant, SAFE (LOTR-RAG + SRAG), incorporates Self-RAG to refine retrieval via query rewriting. We evaluated both systems on 50 fake news articles (2-17 pages) containing 246 annotated claims (M = 4.922, SD = 3.186), labeled as true (14.1%), partly true (14.4%), false (27.0%), partly false (2.2%), and misleading (21.0%) by public health professionals. SAFE systems significantly outperformed baseline LLMs in all metrics (p < 0.001). For consistency (0-1 scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) scored 0.629, exceeding both SAFE (+SRAG) (0.577) and the baseline (0.279). In subjective evaluations (0-4 Likert scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) also achieved the highest average ratings in usefulness (3.640), clearness (3.800), and authenticity (3.526). Adding SRAG slightly reduced overall performance, except for a minor gain in clearness.

This paper introduces two efficient semantic chunking methods, Projected Similarity Chunking (PSC) and Metric Fusion Chunking (MFC), trained on PubMed data using three different embedding models. We further present an evaluation framework that measures the effect of chunking on both retrieval and generation by augmenting PubMedQA with full-text PubMed Central articles. Our results show substantial retrieval improvements (24x with PSC) in MRR and higher Hits@k on PubMedQA. We provide a comprehensive analysis, including statistical significance and response-time comparisons with common chunking libraries.

Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil testing, CAT aims to efficiently and accurately assess examinee abilities by adaptively selecting the most suitable items during the assessment process. However, its real-time and sequential nature presents limitations in practical scenarios, particularly in large-scale assessments where interaction costs are high, or in sensitive domains such as psychological evaluations where minimizing noise and interference is essential. These challenges constrain the applicability of conventional CAT methods in time-sensitive or resourceconstrained environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel task called one-shot adaptive testing (OAT), which aims to select a fixed set of optimal items for each test-taker in a one-time selection. Meanwhile, we propose PEOAT, a Personalization-guided Evolutionary question assembly framework for One-shot Adaptive Testing from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we began by designing a personalization-aware initialization strategy that integrates differences between examinee ability and exercise difficulty, using multi-strategy sampling to construct a diverse and informative initial population. Building on this, we proposed a cognitive-enhanced evolutionary framework incorporating schema-preserving crossover and cognitively guided mutation to enable efficient exploration through informative signals. To maintain diversity without compromising fitness, we further introduced a diversity-aware environmental selection mechanism. The effectiveness of PEOAT is validated through extensive experiments on two datasets, complemented by case studies that uncovered valuable insights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPEOAT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u8bd5\u9898\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5(CAT)\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u6216\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edfCAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPEOAT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8003\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8bd5\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u79cd\u7fa4\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fdd\u7559\u4ea4\u53c9\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u5f02\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u73af\u5883\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1PEOAT\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "PEOAT\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfCAT\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u8bd5\u9898\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Treating these features as static inputs decouples them from the core recommendation task. We address this limitation with a novel framework built on a key insight: deeply fusing multi-modal and collaborative knowledge for representation denoising. Our unified architecture introduces two primary technical innovations. First, we integrate dimensionality reduction directly into the recommendation model, enabling end-to-end co-training that makes the reduction process aware of the final ranking objective. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the collaborative filtering signal into the latent space. This synergistic process refines raw LLM embeddings, filtering noise while amplifying task-relevant signals. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superior discriminative power, proving that this integrated fusion and denoising strategy is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.

One possible strategy involves generating a unique user (or item) profile from historical interaction data, which is then mapped to a semantic representation in the language space. However, a single-instance profile may be insufficient to comprehensively capture the complex intentions behind a user's interacted items. Moreover, due to the inherent instability of LLMs, a biased or misinterpreted profile could even undermine the original recommendation performance. Consequently, an intuitive solution is to generate multiple profiles for each user (or item), each reflecting a distinct aspect of their characteristics. In light of this, we propose a unified recommendation framework with multi-faceted profile extrapolation (ProEx) in this paper. By leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, we construct multiple distinct profiles for each user and item. These new profiles are subsequently mapped into semantic vectors, extrapolating from the position of the original profile to explore a broader region of the language space. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of environments, where each environment represents a possible linear combination of all profiles. The differences across environments are minimized to reveal the inherent invariance of user preferences.

Traditional relevance models typically produce scalar scores or directly predict relevance labels, limiting both interpretability and the modeling of complex relevance signals. Inspired by recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for complex tasks, we investigate whether explicit reasoning can enhance both interpretability and performance in relevance modeling. However, existing reasoning-based Generative Relevance Models (GRMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning on large amounts of human-annotated or synthetic CoT data, which often leads to limited generalization. Moreover, domain-agnostic, free-form reasoning tends to be overly generic and insufficiently grounded, limiting its potential to handle the diverse and ambiguous cases prevalent in open-domain search. In this work, we formulate relevance modeling in Xiaohongshu search as a reasoning task and introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework to enhance the grounded reasoning capabilities of GRMs. Specifically, we incorporate practical business-specific relevance criteria into the multi-step reasoning prompt design and propose Stepwise Advantage Masking (SAM), a lightweight process-supervision strategy which facilitates effective learning of these criteria through improved credit assignment. To enable industrial deployment, we further distill the large-scale RL-tuned model to a lightweight version suitable for real-world search systems.

In past decades, although researchers have developed plenty of models for CVR prediction, the methodological evolution and relationships between different techniques have been precluded. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on CVR prediction in online advertising, and classify state-of-the-art CVR prediction models into six categories with respect to the underlying techniques and elaborate on connections between these techniques. For each category of models, we present the framework of underlying techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss how they are utilized for CVR prediction. Moreover, we summarize the performance of various CVR prediction models on public and proprietary datasets. Finally, we identify research trends, major challenges, and promising future directions. We observe that results of performance evaluation reported in prior studies are not unanimous; semantics-enriched, attribution-enhanced, debiased CVR prediction and jointly modeling CTR and CVR prediction would be promising directions to explore in the future.

Moreover, we construct a comprehensive system of evaluation protocols encompassing real-world and synthetic datasets, a taxonomy of metrics, standardized procedures and experimental guidelines for calibrating the performance of CTR prediction models. Furthermore, we implement the proposed benchmark platform and conduct a comparative study to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models from traditional multivariate statistical to modern large language model (LLM)-based approaches on three public datasets and two synthetic datasets. Experimental results reveal that, (1) high-order models largely outperform low-order models, though such advantage varies in terms of metrics and on different datasets; (2) LLM-based models demonstrate a remarkable data efficiency, i.e., achieving the comparable performance to other models while using only 2% of the training data; (3) the performance of CTR prediction models has achieved significant improvements from 2015 to 2016, then reached a stage with slow progress, which is consistent across various datasets. This benchmark is expected to facilitate model development and evaluation and enhance practitioners' understanding of the underlying mechanisms of models in the area of CTR prediction.

These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6216\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u8c31\u5e26\uff1b2) \u8c31\u5e26\u63a9\u7801\u8c03\u5236\u5e26\u7ea7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b3) \u4f4e\u79e9\u8de8\u5e26\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5408\u9891\u7387\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b4) \u5bf9\u6bd4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u8c31\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u9891\u5e26\u8d21\u732e\u8bca\u65ad", "conclusion": "SSR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}
