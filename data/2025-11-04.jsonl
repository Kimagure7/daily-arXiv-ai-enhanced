Traditional user profiling often overlooks the distinction between\ntransitory short-term interests and stable long-term preferences. This paper\nexamines the capability of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture\nthese temporal dynamics, generating richer user representations through\ndistinct short-term and long-term textual summaries of interaction histories.\nOur observations suggest that while LLMs tend to improve recommendation quality\nin domains with more active user engagement, their benefits appear less\npronounced in sparser environments. This disparity likely stems from the\nvarying distinguishability of short-term and long-term preferences across\ndomains; the approach shows greater utility where these temporal interests are\nmore clearly separable (e.g., Movies\\&TV) compared to domains with more stable\nuser profiles (e.g., Video Games).

This paper is accepted at IEEE BigData 2025 (Short)", "summary": "Contrastive learning (CL) has been widely used for enhancing the performance\nof graph collaborative filtering (GCF) for personalized recommendation. Since\ndata augmentation plays a crucial role in the success of CL, previous works\nhave designed augmentation methods to remove noisy interactions between users\nand items in order to generate effective augmented views. However, the\nambiguity in defining ''noisiness'' presents a persistent risk of losing core\ninformation and generating unreliable data views, while increasing the overall\ncomplexity of augmentation. In this paper, we propose Simple Collaborative\nAugmentation for Recommendation (SCAR), a novel and intuitive augmentation\nmethod designed to maximize the effectiveness of CL for GCF. Instead of\nremoving information, SCAR leverages collaborative signals extracted from\nuser-item interactions to generate pseudo-interactions, which are then either\nadded to or used to replace existing interactions. This results in more robust\nrepresentations while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex augmentation\nmodules. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that SCAR\noutperforms previous CL-based GCF methods as well as other state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning approaches across key evaluation metrics. SCAR\nexhibits strong robustness across different hyperparameter settings and is\nparticularly effective in sparse data scenarios."}

We identify an essential limitation of existing paradigms:\ntheir inability to capture global, listwise dependencies among sequence items.\nTo address this, we formulate User Behavior Trajectory Prediction (UBTP) as a\nnew task setting that explicitly models long-term user preferences. We\nintroduce Listwise Preference Diffusion Optimization (LPDO), a diffusion-based\ntraining framework that directly optimizes structured preferences over entire\nitem sequences. LPDO incorporates a Plackett-Luce supervision signal and\nderives a tight variational lower bound aligned with listwise ranking\nlikelihoods, enabling coherent preference generation across denoising steps and\novercoming the independent-token assumption of prior diffusion methods. To\nrigorously evaluate multi-step prediction quality, we propose the task-specific\nmetric Sequential Match (SeqMatch), which measures exact trajectory agreement,\nand adopt Perplexity (PPL), which assesses probabilistic fidelity. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world user behavior benchmarks demonstrate that LPDO\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new\nbenchmark for structured preference learning with diffusion models."}

Furthermore, these\napproaches fail to capture the complex interactions between users and items,\nlimiting the model's ability to meet diverse users. To address these\nchallenges, we present SRGFormer, a structurally optimized multimodal\nrecommendation model.
