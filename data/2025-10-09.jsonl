Traditional machine learning\nclassifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a\nlack of deep, nuanced comprehension. The \"LLM-as-annotators\" approach addresses\nthese by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation\nof subtle attributes. This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing:\n(1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by\noffline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of\nvideo corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and\nknowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich\nannotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through\npersonalized restrict retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy\nof this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation\nquality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user\nparticipation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. The study provides\ninsights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich\ncontent evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated\nnuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and\nthe overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems."}

Quantifying Equivalence in LLM-in-the-loop Annotation Tasks", "comment": "Accepted at SIGIR-AP 2025", "summary": "Many evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in text annotation focus\nprimarily on the correctness of the output, typically comparing model-generated\nlabels to human-annotated ``ground truth'' using standard performance metrics.\nIn contrast, our study moves beyond effectiveness alone. We aim to explore how\nlabeling decisions -- by both humans and LLMs -- can be statistically evaluated\nacross individuals. Rather than treating LLMs purely as annotation systems, we\napproach LLMs as an alternative annotation mechanism that may be capable of\nmimicking the subjective judgments made by humans. To assess this, we develop a\nstatistical evaluation method based on Krippendorff's $\\alpha$, paired\nbootstrapping, and the Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) equivalence test procedure.\nThis evaluation method tests whether an LLM can blend into a group of human\nannotators without being distinguishable.\n  We apply this approach to two datasets -- MovieLens 100K and PolitiFact --\nand find that the LLM is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator\nin the former ($p = 0.004$), but not in the latter ($p = 0.155$), highlighting\ntask-dependent differences. It also enables early evaluation on a small sample\nof human data to inform whether LLMs are suitable for large-scale annotation in\na given application."}

However, the inner decision process of these models\nremains largely unclear, especially as models increase in size. Most\ninterpretability approaches, such as probing, focus on correlational insights\nrather than establishing causal relationships. The paper 'Axiomatic Causal\nInterventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval\nModels' by Chen et al. addresses this gap by introducing a framework for\nactivation patching - a causal interpretability method - in the information\nretrieval domain, offering insights into how neural retrieval models compute\ndocument relevance. The study demonstrates that neural ranking models not only\ncapture term-frequency information, but also that these representations can be\nlocalized to specific components of the model, such as individual attention\nheads or layers. This paper aims to reproduce the findings by Chen et al. and\nto further explore the presence of pre-defined retrieval axioms in neural IR\nmodels. We validate the main claims made by Chen et al., and extend the\nframework to include an additional term-frequency axiom, which states that the\nimpact of increasing query term frequency on document ranking diminishes as the\nfrequency becomes higher. We successfully identify a group of attention heads\nthat encode this axiom and analyze their behavior to give insight into the\ninner decision-making process of neural ranking models."}

To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark\nspanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the\ndocument- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model\nthat outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot\nlearning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this\nbenchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this\nblack-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability.\nBuilding on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE.
