To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework\nthat integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization\nvia attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement\nAttention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with\nchannel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns\nbetween visual and textual modalities.

Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across\ngeographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage\nregional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper\ninvestigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client\nselection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a\ncarbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest\nextension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training\nrounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of\nsuch scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,\nselection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates.

In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers.

To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa.

This\nimprovement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN\nalgorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR\nfeatures.
