Abstract: Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.

TL;DR: GovScape是一个支持多模态搜索的公共系统，用于搜索2020年联邦政府爬取的1000多万个PDF文档，提供元数据过滤、精确文本搜索、语义文本搜索和视觉搜索功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网页档案虽然保存了大量政府PDF文档，但在访问和发现方面存在显著挑战，目前只能下载单个PDF或进行基本关键词搜索，缺乏更智能的搜索功能。

Method: 开发了GovScape系统，包含搜索功能、嵌入管道、系统架构和开源代码库，支持四种主要搜索方式：元数据过滤、精确文本搜索、语义文本搜索和视觉搜索。

Result: 成功处理了10,015,993个联邦政府PDF文档（总计70,958,487页），总计算成本约为1500美元，相当于每美元处理47,000页PDF，展示了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: GovScape系统证明了多模态搜索在千万级PDF规模上的可行性，并已开始向亿级PDF规模扩展，为大规模政府文档的智能访问提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efforts over the past three decades have produced web archives containing billions of webpage snapshots and petabytes of data. The End of Term Web Archive alone contains, among other file types, millions of PDFs produced by the federal government. While preservation with web archives has been successful, significant challenges for access and discoverability remain. For example, current affordances for browsing the End of Term PDFs are limited to downloading and browsing individual PDFs, as well as performing basic keyword search across them. In this paper, we introduce GovScape, a public search system that supports multimodal searches across 10,015,993 federal government PDFs from the 2020 End of Term crawl (70,958,487 total PDF pages) - to our knowledge, all renderable PDFs in the 2020 crawl that are 50 pages or under. GovScape supports four primary forms of search over these 10 million PDFs: in addition to providing (1) filter conditions over metadata facets including domain and crawl date and (2) exact text search against the PDF text, we provide (3) semantic text search and (4) visual search against the PDFs across individual pages, enabling users to structure queries such as "redacted documents" or "pie charts." We detail the constituent components of GovScape, including the search affordances, embedding pipeline, system architecture, and open source codebase. Significantly, the total estimated compute cost for GovScape's pre-processing pipeline for 10 million PDFs was approximately $1,500, equivalent to 47,000 PDF pages per dollar spent on compute, demonstrating the potential for immediate scalability. Accordingly, we outline steps that we have already begun pursuing toward multimodal search at the 100+ million PDF scale. GovScape can be found at https://www.govscape.net.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于软插补奇异值分解的群组推荐系统Group Soft-Impute SVD，用于解决群组推荐中的数据稀疏性和高维性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着群组活动的普及，需要基于群组成员集体偏好为群组提供推荐。现有群组推荐系统在处理稀疏高维数据时存在困难。

Method: 使用软插补奇异值分解进行低秩矩阵补全，通过Group Soft-Impute SVD方法增强群组推荐。

Result: 在Goodbooks、Movielens和合成数据集上，该方法在小用户群组的召回率上优于基于群组矩阵分解的基线方法，在所有群组规模上获得可比结果，且能恢复更低的矩阵秩。

Conclusion: Group Soft-Impute SVD方法能有效处理高维数据，在群组推荐任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The growing popularity of group activities increased the need to develop methods for providing recommendations to a group of users based on the collective preferences of the group members. Several group recommender systems have been proposed, but these methods often struggle due to sparsity and high-dimensionality of the available data, common in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our method recovers lower matrix ranks than the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multi-step reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Align$^3$GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play (SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic preference adaptation. Experiments show Align$^3$GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and +20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform.

TL;DR: MOON是一个用于电商多模态表示学习的可持续迭代实践框架，已在淘宝搜索广告系统中全面部署，在CTR预测任务上实现了20.00%的在线点击率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态表示学习与下游任务目标不一致的问题，通过定义"交换率"来量化中间指标改进对下游收益的转化效果。

Method: 采用"预训练、后训练、应用"三阶段训练范式，通过数据预处理、训练策略、模型架构和下游应用四个维度的持续迭代优化。

Result: 在淘宝搜索广告系统的检索、相关性、排序等所有阶段部署，CTR预测任务实现20.00%的在线点击率提升，是过去三年最大的CTR改进项目。

Conclusion: MOON框架通过系统化的迭代实践和多维度优化，成功解决了多模态表示学习与下游任务的集成问题，并探索了电商领域的缩放规律。

Abstract: We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.

### [6] [SRLF: An Agent-Driven Set-Wise Reflective Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11370)
*Jiahao Wang,Bokang Fu,Yu Zhu,Yuli Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了基于集合的反思学习框架SRLF，通过"评估-验证-反思"闭环循环，利用LLM的上下文学习能力对完整项目集进行整体判断，解决了传统点对点方法在用户偏好理解和项目语义表示方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理主要关注单个项目的用户评分建模，这种点对点方法导致用户偏好理解不准确和项目语义表示僵化的问题。

Method: SRLF框架采用集合层面的整体判断方法，综合分析项目集中的复杂相互关系及其与用户偏好配置的集体对齐，通过"评估-验证-反思"闭环循环实现。

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法的有效性，确认集合视角对于在序列推荐任务中实现最先进性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 集合层面的上下文理解方法能够捕捉用户行为中复杂的关系模式，使模型在序列推荐中表现显著更佳。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are emerging as a promising paradigm for simulating user behavior to enhance recommender systems. However, their effectiveness is often limited by existing studies that focus on modeling user ratings for individual items. This point-wise approach leads to prevalent issues such as inaccurate user preference comprehension and rigid item-semantic representations.
  To address these limitations, we propose the novel Set-wise Reflective Learning Framework (SRLF). Our framework operationalizes a closed-loop "assess-validate-reflect" cycle that harnesses the powerful in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. SRLF departs from conventional point-wise assessment by formulating a holistic judgment on an entire set of items. It accomplishes this by comprehensively analyzing both the intricate interrelationships among items within the set and their collective alignment with the user's preference profile. This method of set-level contextual understanding allows our model to capture complex relational patterns essential to user behavior, making it significantly more adept for sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, confirming that this set-wise perspective is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommendation tasks.
